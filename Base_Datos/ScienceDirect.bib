abstract = {As artificial intelligence is being increasingly used for high-stakes applications, it is becoming more and more important that the models used be interpretable. Bayesian networks offer a paradigm for interpretable artificial intelligence that is based on probability theory. They provide a semantics that enables a compact, declarative representation of a joint probability distribution over the variables of a domain by leveraging the conditional independencies among them. The representation consists of a directed acyclic graph that encodes the conditional independencies among the variables and a set of parameters that encodes conditional distributions. This representation has provided a basis for the development of algorithms for probabilistic reasoning (inference) and for learning probability distributions from data. Bayesian networks are used for a wide range of tasks in machine learning, including clustering, supervised classification, multi-dimensional supervised classification, anomaly detection, and temporal modeling. They also provide a basis for estimation of distribution algorithms, a class of evolutionary algorithms for heuristic optimization. We illustrate the use of Bayesian networks for interpretable machine learning and optimization by presenting applications in neuroscience, the industry, and bioinformatics, covering a wide range of machine learning and optimization tasks.},

abstract = {The unequal distribution of educational opportunities between urban and rural areas is still a significant challenge in China. As a result, students from urban areas can benefit from highly qualified teachers and enjoy state-of-the-art facilities in contrast with their rural counterparts. Consequently, students from urban areas are more likely to join higher education institutes in comparison with their rural counterparts. In such a scenario, a cloud-based virtual learning environment (C-VLE) is of great importance to provide quality education in rural areas. This study aims to predict C-VLE usage's impact on academic performance and gender differences in rural China. The respondents belonged to rural areas and experienced varying levels of such difficulties. This study extended the task-technology fit theory with the channel expansion theory. The study revealed that task-technology fit, individual-technology fit, perceived media richness, omnipresence, and interactivity positively influence C-VLE usage that leads elevating academic performance. As a result, the students from rural areas have a better competitive position than their urban counterparts. Surprisingly, gender did not play any moderating role. The study provides significant theoretical and practical implications for scholars, educational authorities, and policymakers.},

abstract = {COVID-19 was first discovered in Wuhan, China on December 2019. It is one of the worst pandemics in human history. The education sector is one of the sectors most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Educators and students worldwide were forced to shift to online learning. Students, in particular, have suffered from the psychological impacts and learning difficulties caused by the lockdowns imposed by governments to control the pandemic. In this study, we used statistics and machine learning approaches to study the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on educations systems especially on university students' psychological health. For this purpose, a questionnaire was created,which consisted of two primary parts. The first part collects the participant's demographic and educational characteristics, while the second part gathers information about five primary dimensions: the use of digital devices, sleep habits, social communication, emotional mental state, and academic performance. The questionnaire was distributed to university students in three Arab countries: Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. A total of 1766 responses were returned and analyzed using statistical and machine learning approaches. The results showed an evident correlation between student's psychological health and the use of online education during the time COVID-19. The results also showed that there is a positive relationship between digital tools used for online education and the academic performance of students during the time of COVID-19. Finally, the results highlighted the harmful impacts of COVID-19 on the education systems. The study ends by presenting suggestions and recommendations needed to improve the current online education system. Moreover, it is warranted for universities to have a role in helping students respond to the pandemic in a healthier psychological performance.},

However, further conceptual and methodological understanding is needed to advance the systematic implementation of these approaches. The first objective of this study is to test a systematic procedure for implementing artificial neural networks to predict academic performance in higher education. The second objective is to analyze the importance of several well-known predictors of academic performance in higher education. The sample included 162,030 students of both genders from private and public universities in Colombia. The findings suggest that it is possible to systematically implement artificial neural networks to classify students' academic performance as either high (accuracy of 82{\%}) or low (accuracy of 71{\%}). Artificial neural networks outperform other machine-learning algorithms in evaluation metrics such as the recall and the F1 score. Furthermore, it is found that prior academic achievement, socioeconomic conditions, and high school characteristics are important predictors of students' academic performance in higher education. Finally, this study discusses recommendations for implementing artificial neural networks and several considerations for the analysis of academic performance in higher education.},

The evaluation of student performance in educational institutions reveals the degree of effort that educational institutions should do in order to improve the poor or average learner. The importance of using EDM models is that they leverage prior data from stu- dents to forecast unanticipated or impending student performance.

abstract = {Background: Despite powerful efforts to maximize nursing school enrollment, schools and colleges of nursing are faced with high rates of attrition and low rates of completion. Early identification of at-risk students and the factors associated with graduation outcomes are the main foci for the studies that have addressed attrition and completion rates in nursing programs. Machine learning has been shown to perform better in prediction tasks than traditional statistical methods. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to identify adequate models that predict, early in a students career, if an undergraduate nursing student will graduate within six college years. In addition, factors related to successful graduation were to be identified using several of the algorithms. Design: Predictions were made at five time points: the beginning of the first, second, third, fourth years, and the end of the sixth year. Fourteen scenarios were built for each machine learning algorithm through the combinations of different variable sections and time points. Settings: College of Nursing in a private university in an urban Midwest city, USA. Participants: Seven hundred and seventy-three full time, first time, and degree-seeking students who enrolled from 2004 through 2012 in a traditional 4-year baccalaureate nursing program. Methods: Eight popular machine learning algorithms were chosen for model construction and comparison. In addition, a stacked ensemble method was introduced in the study to boost the accuracy and reduce the variance of prediction. Results: Using one year of college academic performance, the graduation outcome can be correctly predicted for over 80{\%} of the students. The prediction accuracy can reach 90{\%} after the second college year and 99{\%} after the third year. Among all the variables, cumulative grade points average (GPA) and nursing course GPA are the most influential factors for predicting graduation. Conclusions: This study provides a potential mode of data-based tracking system for nursing students during their entire baccalaureate program. This tracking system can serve a large number of students automatically to provide customized evaluation on the dropout risk students and enhance the ability of a school or college to more strategically design school-based prevention and interventional services.},

The framework was evaluated by using different activation functions (Sigmoid, ReLu, and Tanh) and optimizers (Adagrad and Adadelta). A dataset created from over 30000 entries grouped in 74 teams was used for training and evaluating the framework. Additionally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach was used to interpret the framework and extract the most important features having a positive or negative impact on its final prediction. Among other conclusions, it was shown that the prediction accuracy of the framework, when the Adadelta and Adagrad optimizers were used, was found to be 76.73{\%} and 82.39{\%}, respectively, while its overall learning performance was 80.76{\%} and 86.57{\%}, meaning that it is capable of predicting teams' performance adequately and accurately.},

A knowledge of the factors that affect student learning could help universities and study centres adjust their curricula and teaching methods to the needs of their students. One of the first measures employed by teaching institutions was to create Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs). This type of environment makes it possible to attract a larger number of students because it enables them to study from wherever they are in the world, meaning that the student's location is no longer a constraint. Moreover, VLEs facilitate access to teaching resources, they make it easier to monitor the activity of the teaching staff and of the interactions between students and teachers. Thus, online environments make it possible to assess the factors that cause the students' academic performance to increase or decrease. To understand the factors that influence the university learning process, this paper applies a series of automatic learning techniques to a public dataset, including tree-based models and different types of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Having applied these techniques to the dataset, the number of times students have accessed the resources made available on VLE platforms has been identified as a key factor affecting student performance. This factor has been analysed by conducting a real case study which has involved 120 students doing a masters degree over a VLE platform. Concretely, the case study participants were masters degree students in areas related to computer engineering at the University of Salamanca.},

A set of features, including online duration, Internet traffic volume, and connection frequency, were extracted, calculated and normalized from the real Internet usage data of 4000 students. Three common machine learning algorithms of decision tree, neural network and support vector machine were used to predict academic performance from these features. The results indicate that behavior discipline plays a vital role in academic success. Internet connection frequency features are positively correlated with academic performance, whereas Internet traffic volume features are negatively associated with academic performance. From the perspective of the online time features, Internet time consumed results in unexpected performance between different datasets. Furthermore, as the number of features increase, prediction accuracy is generally improved in the methods.

abstract = {Educational data mining has gained impressive attention in recent years. The primary focus of educational institutions is to provide quality education for students to enhance academic performance. The performance of students depends on several aspects, i.e., personal, academic, and behavioural features. The present study deals with predicting students' academic performance in a technical institution in India. A dataset was obtained using a questionnaire-based survey and the academic section of the chosen institution. Data-pre-processing and factor analysis have been performed on the obtained dataset to remove the anomalies in the data, reduce the dimensionality of data and obtain the most correlated feature. The Python 3 tool is used for the comparison of machine learning algorithms. The support vector regression{\_}linear algorithm provided superior prediction.},

abstract = {The study project named "Effects of Co-Curricular Activities on Student's Academic Performance Through Machine Learning" examines the effect of co-curricular activities on a student's academic performance. The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between extracurricular activities and student performance. Co-curricular activities are extracurricular activities that support and enhance the academic or core curriculum. They are a vital component of educational institutions' attempts to help students develop their personalities and improve classroom learning. However, a significant proportion of pupils in Bangladesh do not participate in such activities. One of the primary reasons is because many believe these activities would jeopardize a student's academic performance. This study's objective is to ascertain the actual effect of co-curricular activities on pupils. It was discovered that there is a positive correlation between co-curricular activities and academic performance using Logistic Regression using Python and Google Colab.},
