abstract = {Every day organizations have more information because their systems produce a large amount of daily operations which are stored in transactional databases. In order to analyze this historical information, an interesting alternative is to implement a Data Warehouse. In the other hand, Data Warehouses are not able to perform predictive analysis for themselves, but machine learning techniques can be used to classify, grouping and predict historical information in order to improve the quality of analysis. This paper depicts architecture of a Data Warehouse useful to perform an analysis of students' academic performance. The Data Warehouse is used as input of a Neural Network in order to analyze historical information and forecast. The results show the viability of using Data Warehouse for academic performance analysis and the feasibility of predicting the number of approved courses for students using only their own historical information.},

abstract = {Student retention is an essential part of many enrollment management systems. It affects university rankings, school reputation, and financial wellbeing. Student retention has become one of the most important priorities for decision makers in higher education institutions. Improving student retention starts with a thorough understanding of the reasons behind the attrition. Such an understanding is the basis for accurately predicting at-risk students and appropriately intervening to retain them. In this study, using five years of institutional data along with several data mining techniques (both individuals as well as ensembles), we developed analytical models to predict and to explain the reasons behind freshmen student attrition. The comparative analyses results showed that the ensembles performed better than individual models, while the balanced dataset produced better prediction results than the unbalanced dataset. The sensitivity analysis of the models revealed that the educational and financial variables are among the most important predictors of the phenomenon. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The phenomenon of dropout, by its complexity and educational and social impact, has been extensively studied to understand the specific causes. In this line of research, the purpose of this study was to analyze explanatory and predictive models of student dropout from university studies at the Instituto Tecnol{\'{o}}gico de Costa Rica (TEC), based on many variables recorded in the institutional system indicators. The first stage of the analysis considered multinomial regression models to identify the influence of these variables on the dropout. In the second analysis, six machine learning algorithms were evaluated in order to find a model that would predict student dropout. Data analysis showed that the probability of dropping out is related to sociodemographic variables, study program, academic history, scholarship and other benefits, and performance after first semester. In addition, the best predictor of dropout algorithm was the "random forest", a probability of 0.83 to predict the dropout correctly and to capture 34{\%} of the actual student dropout. These results are the first step toward building a more robust predictive model of dropout, which will contribute to preventive decision making in this university.},

abstract = {Mining data in educational filed is an important and useful task for anybody related to educational institute. The useful information mined from the data can help with performance, guidance, teaching, planning and etc. for staff, students and instructors. Different educational data mining researches has been carried out on student data which includes the student's basic achievements and educational background, academic scores and the amount of credit hours, but the relations between these are limited. Therefore in this paper we have described a system using data mining technologies such as decision tree. We have analyzed ID3 and J48 (C4.5) algorithms for predicting the scholarship winning chances on student data by translating the decision tree into "IF-THEN" rules and implementing these rules for prediction in our system called scholarship calculator. We have mined student data to calculate the chances of winning scholarship depending on their semester grades, position/rank of student in class, achievements, maximum and minimum amount of taken and allowed credit hours and extra curriculum activities. We found that ID3 works better even though J48 is faster in classifying data and creates a smaller tree than ID3. Because of ID3's bigger tree it has more rule, more rules means more crosschecking and deeper decision, that's why the predicted result was more accurate than J48. We have also described how our scholarship calculator works to predict and calculate the chances of winning scholarship. Performance evaluation is done and the results are also compared with already existing datasets. The developed system could be very useful in predicting student's chances of winning scholarship from the first semester. It can help students to pinpoint the weak areas, which can be perfected with proper guidance from instructors and staff for better chances of winning scholarship.},

Initially, we performed a descriptive statistical analysis to gain insight from data. Subsequently, two datasets were obtained. The first dataset contains variables obtained prior to the start of the school year, and the second included academic variables collected two months after the semester began. Classification models based on the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) were created to predict academic outcomes of student performance at the end of the school year for each dataset. Results showed that, though the attributes ‘grades' and ‘absences' were the most relevant for predicting the end of the year academic outcomes of student performance, the analysis of demographic attributes reveals that ‘neighborhood' ‘school' and ‘age' are also potential indicators of a student's academic success or failure.},

Finally uses a machine learning algorithm to classify the users according to their level of knowledge. The results show how the time a student stays in the platform is not related to belonging to the high knowledge group. Three categories of users were identified, applying the Fuzzy K-means methodology to determine transition zones between levels of knowledge.

Although such factors have been widely analyzed from quantitative and qualitative approaches, they still represent research opportunities using artificial intelligence tools, particularly in academic performance prediction. With the definition of influential factors (educational, family background, social and economics, habits and customs, among others), a methodology was designed to train a system able to a priori classify a new student, in one of the five categories of academic performance. This classification allows an educational institution to have an early identification of students with potential academic performance problems. From this knowledge the institution can deploy immediate mitigation action. The methodology was applied to a sample of students from a public university in Colombia, obtaining a success level of 91.7{\%}.},

Logistic regression models are used for the purpose of classification. Experiments conducted with data on over 100 students for several distance learning courses confirm the predictive power of our proposal. Using the resulting predictive models we have designed a tutoring action plan. Applying this plan, we managed to reduce the dropout rate by 14{\%} with respect to previous academic years in which no dropout prevention mechanism was applied. Our main contribution is a tool and a tutoring plan that can be used by our educational institution (and others) to reduce dropout rate in e-learning courses.},

abstract = {The field of e-learning has emerged as a topic of interest in academia due to the increased ease of accessing the Internet using using smart-phones and wireless devices. One of the challenges facing e-learning platforms is how to keep students motivated and engaged. Moreover, it is also crucial to identify the students that might need help in order to make sure their academic performance doesn't suffer. To that end, this paper tries to investigate the relationship between student engagement and their academic performance. Apriori association rules algorithm is used to derive a set of rules that relate student engagement to academic performance. Experimental results' analysis done using confidence and lift metrics show that a positive correlation exists between students' engagement level and their academic performance in a blended e-learning environment. In particular, it is shown that higher engagement often leads to better academic performance. This cements the previous work that linked engagement and academic performance in traditional classrooms.},

This ever-changing landscape has allowed management to use educational data for strategic decision-making, offered students with relevant information to improve academic performance, and provided teachers with data on learners' behavior for effective teaching. To assess academically at-risk students, teachers need to gain valuable insights on student engagement, which includes class attendance, library and computer laboratory access, and use of other learning resources so that they can tailor the learning needs of students. Data analytics is used to examine student engagement inside and outside the classroom and predict learning trends. The popularity of Internet of Things and the convergence of RFID, Wireless Sensor Networks, Big Data, and Cloud Computing have enabled organizations to implement innovative information systems; however, their integrative potential has not been thoroughly explored. Having an RFID in combination with data analytics will provide various academic stakeholders valuable and critical information as regards students' learning behavior. Therefore, this paper reviews current trends of RFID in education and discusses opportunities of data analytics integration. Moreover, this paper also presents a conceptual framework of a basic RFID Analytic System that can be used in assessing student engagement.},

abstract = {La deserci{\'{o}}n escolar involucra diversos factores, entre ellos, el compromiso del estudiante, a trav{\'{e}}s del cual se puede predecir su {\'{e}}xito en la escuela. Ese compromiso tiene varios componentes, tales como conductual, emocional y cognitivo. La motivaci{\'{o}}n y el compromiso est{\'{a}}n fuertemente relacionadas, ya que la primera es un precursor del compromiso. El objetivo de este estudio fue comparar la eficacia de la regresi{\'{o}}n lineal contra dos t{\'{e}}cnicas de miner{\'{i}}a de datos para predecir el rendimiento acad{\'{e}}mico de los estudiantes en la educaci{\'{o}}n superior. Se hizo un estudio transversal explicativo en el que se encuest{\'{o}} a 222 estudiantes universitarios de una instituci{\'{o}}n p{\'{u}}blica de la Ciudad de M{\'{e}}xico. Se realiz{\'{o}} un an{\'{a}}lisis de regresi{\'{o}}n lineal jer{\'{a}}rquico (RL) y de t{\'{e}}cnicas de anal{\'{i}}tica del aprendizaje, como redes neuronales (RN) y m{\'{a}}quinas de vector soporte (SVM). Para evaluar la exactitud de las t{\'{e}}cnicas de anal{\'{i}}tica del aprendizaje se realiz{\'{o}} un an{\'{a}}lisis de varianza (ANOVA). Se compararon las t{\'{e}}cnicas de anal{\'{i}}tica del aprendizaje y de regresi{\'{o}}n lineal usando la validaci{\'{o}}n cruzada. Los resultados mostraron que el compromiso conductual y la autoeficacia tuvieron efectos positivos en el desempe{\~{n}}o del estudiante, mientras que la pasividad mostr{\'{o}} un efecto negativo. Asimismo, las t{\'{e}}cnicas de RL y de SVM pronosticaron igualmente el desempe{\~{n}}o acad{\'{e}}mico de los estudiantes. La RL tuvo la ventaja de producir un modelo simple y de f{\'{a}}cil interpretaci{\'{o}}n. Por el contrario, la t{\'{e}}cnica de SVM gener{\'{o}} un modelo m{\'{a}}s complejo, aunque, si el modelo tuviese como objetivo el pron{\'{o}}stico del desempe{\~{n}}o, la t{\'{e}}cnica SVM ser{\'{i}}a la m{\'{a}}s adecuada, ya que no requiere la verificaci{\'{o}}n de ning{\'{u}}n supuesto estad{\'{i}}stico.},

abstract = {The research on the educational field that involves Data Mining techniques is rapidly increasing. Applying Data Mining techniques in an educational background are known as Educational Data Mining that aims to discover hidden knowledge and patterns about student's performance. This work aims to develop student's academic performance prediction model, for the Bachelor and Master degree students in Computer Science and Electronics and Communication streams using two selected classification methods; Decision Tree and Fuzzy Genetic Algorithm. Parameters like internal marks, sessional marks and admission score were selected to conduct this work. Internal marks are the combination of attendance marks, average marks obtained from two sessional exams and assignment marks. Admission score for degree students is the weighted score obtained from 10th and 12th examination marks and entrance marks. In the case of master's degree students, it includes degree examination marks and entrance marks. Resultant prediction model can be used to identify student's performance for each subject. Thereby, the lecturers can classify students and take an early action to improve their performance. Systematic approaches can be taken to improve the performance with time. Due to early prediction and solutions are done, better results can be expected in final exams. Students can view their academic information and updates. Reputed companies having a tie-up with the institution can search students according to their requirements.},

abstract = {In this article, we present a predictive analysis of the academic performance of students in public schools of the Federal District of Brazil during the school terms of 2015 and 2016. Initially, we performed a descriptive statistical analysis to gain insight from data. Subsequently, two datasets were obtained. The first dataset contains variables obtained prior to the start of the school year, and the second included academic variables collected two months after the semester began. Classification models based on the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) were created to predict academic outcomes of student performance at the end of the school year for each dataset. Results showed that, though the attributes ‘grades' and ‘absences' were the most relevant for predicting the end of the year academic outcomes of student performance, the analysis of demographic attributes reveals that ‘neighborhood' ‘school' and ‘age' are also potential indicators of a student's academic success or failure.},

For this, the machine learning tools, main components, clustering, fuzzy and the algorithm of the K nearest neighbor were used. The methodology first relates the users according to the study variables, to then implement a cluster analysis that identifies the formation of groups. Finally uses a machine learning algorithm to classify the users according to their level of knowledge. The results show how the time a student stays in the platform is not related to belonging to the high knowledge group. Three categories of users were identified, applying the Fuzzy K-means methodology to determine transition zones between levels of knowledge. The k nearest neighbor algorithm presents the best prediction results with 91{\%}.},

There have been many studies that sought to examine this issue and most of these studies have focused on pointing out the hard work, demographic variables (education, income, age, marital status), self-motivation as factors that have a significant effect on the MBA student's academic performance. Besides these factors, some social (student-class mates relationships, student-lecturer relationships), individual (work experience, skills) and organizational (location, work atmosphere, technology facilities) factors are assumed to have effect on MBA student's academic success. The aim of this study is to determine some factors effecting MBA Students' performance at Institution of Business Economics of Istanbul University. Accordingly, demographic, social, individual and organizational factors are studied. A survey is conducted to collect the data. Categorical Regression Analysis (CATREG) is applied as Statistical Method. CATREG is an optimal scaling method and can be used when the dependent variable and also the independent variables are any combination of numeric, nominal and ordinal. Categorical regression quantifies categorical data by assigning numerical values to the categories, resulting in an optimal linear regression equation for the transformed variables.},

Although such factors have been widely analyzed from quantitative and qualitative approaches, they still represent research opportunities using artificial intelligence tools, particularly in academic performance prediction. With the definition of influential factors (educational, family background, social and economics, habits and customs, among others), a methodology was designed to train a system able to a priori classify a new student, in one of the five categories of academic performance. This classification allows an educational institution to have an early identification of students with potential academic performance problems. From this knowledge the institution can deploy immediate mitigation action. The methodology was applied to a sample of students from a public university in Colombia, obtaining a success level of 91.7{\%}.},

One hundred two community colleges in 22 states have joined Achieving the Dream: Community Colleges Count. Backed by a partnership of foundations and research organizations, the effort provides funding, coaching, and data-driven best practices aimed at improving student outcomes. It targets schools with high enrollments of minority and low-income students and those taking developmental education and "gatekeeper" courses, such as college algebra, chemistry, and composition. The program is joined by a number of other initiatives that encourage community colleges to apply this notion of evidence-based reforms to the evaluation of their successes and failures. In this article, the author talks about the push for data-driven reforms and contends that data-driven approaches to improve student outcomes are promising but do not offer "overnight success."

Two data mining models were defined to analyze the academic and nonacademic data; the models use two classification techniques, na{\"{i}}ve Bayes and a decision tree classifier, in order to acquire a better understanding of the attrition during the first enrollments and to assess the quality of the data for the classification task, which can be understood as the prediction of the loss of academic status due to low academic performance. The models aim to predict the attrition in the student's first four enrollments. First, considering any of these periods, and then, at a specific enrollment. Historical academic records and data from the admission process were used to train the models, which were evaluated using cross-validation and previously unseen records from a full academic period. Experimental results show that the prediction of the loss of academic status is improved when the academic data are added.},
