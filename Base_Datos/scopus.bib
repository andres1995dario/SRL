abstract = {This research study identifies variables that influence the prediction of performance in industrial engineering undergraduate students at the Universidad Distrital (Colombia) by three methodologies: filter, wrappers, and integrated. Python programming language classification algorithms such as decision tree, K nearest neighbors, and perceptron are implemented and they are compared to obtain the best prediction results. The results show that gender and the ICFES Score (Colombian nation-wide university admission exam) for mathematics were in the upper range in all the selection methods. The Perceptron algorithm is the most accurate of all the algorithms tested. It is concluded that the variables that most affect academic performance in engineering students are: age, gender, tuition fee, the overall ICFES score, and the ICFES scores for mathematical aptitude and cohort mathematics.},

These are benefited by the automation of many processes involved in usual students' activities which handle massive volumes of data collected from software tools for technology-enhanced learning. Thus, analyzing and processing these data carefully can give us useful information about the students' knowledge and the relationship between them and the academic tasks. This information is the source that feeds promising algorithms and methods able to predict students' performance. In this study, almost 70 papers were analyzed to show different modern techniques widely applied for predicting students' performance, together with the objectives they must reach in this field. These techniques and methods, which pertain to the area of Artificial Intelligence, are mainly Machine Learning, Collaborative Filtering, Recommender Systems, and Artificial Neural Networks, among others.},

This study collected seven datasets within three universities located in Taiwan and Japan and listed performance metrics of risk identification model after fed data into eight classification methods. U1, U2, and U3 were used to denote the three universities, which have three, two, and two cases of datasets (learning logs), respectively. According to the results of this study, the factors influencing the predictive performance of classification methods are the number of significant features, the number of categories of significant features, and Spearman correlation coefficient values. In U1 dataset case 1.3 and U2 dataset case 2.2, the numbers of significant features, numbers of categories of significant features, and Spearman correlation coefficient values for significant features were all relatively high, which is the main reason why these datasets were able to perform classification with high predictive ability.},

This has not only burdened applicants but also led to an increased workload on admission faculty members of universities. Any chance of abridging the admission process impelled applicants and faculty workers to look for faster, efficient, and more accurate methods for predicting admissions. The goal approach of this paper is to implement and compare several supervised predictive analysis methods on a labeled dataset based on real applications from the prestigious university of UCLA; Regression, classification, and Ensemble methods are all the supervised methods that are to be employed for prediction. The dataset relies profoundly on the academic performance of the applicants during their undergrad years. The coefficient of determination, as well as precision and accuracy, are the measures used to compare the different models. All predictive methods proved to show accurate results, however; certain methods proved to be more promising than others were. Predictions were obtained within short time frames, which in turn will cut down the time in the admission process.},

We have conducted a research survey within the University of Jordan students that is covering all faculties and cover a vast range of different students. Using both JRIP and PART we have concluded fundamental remarks; mainly, we have noticed that using YouTube as a learning resource has positive impacts on students' performance especially within scientific faculties. Moreover, we have interpreted the impact of other factors, such as having an Internet connection, having several social media applications and others. Certainly, upon our findings, we recommend the importance of integrating YouTube as a learning resource within universities learning environments.},

They are interested in prediction accuracy but pay less attention to interpretability. We propose a stacking ensemble model to predict and analyze student performance in academic competition. In this model, student performance is classified into two symmetrical categorical classes. To improve accuracy, three machine learning algorithms, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest, and AdaBoost are established in the first level and then integrated by logistic regression via stacking. A feature importance analysis was applied to identify important variables. The experimental data were collected from four academic years in Hankou University. According to comparative studies on five evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1, error, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in this analysis, the proposed model generally performs better than compared models. The important variables identified from the analysis are interpretable, they can be used as guidance to select potential students.},

It also removes redundant training vectors to reduce the training time and support vectors. To examine the effectiveness of the proposed RTV-SVM, 32,593 university students on seven courses were chosen for performance evaluation. Analysis reveals that the RTV-SVM achieved a training vector reduction of at least 59.7{\%} without altering the margin or accuracy of the classifier. Moreover, the results showed the proposed method to be capable of achieving overall accuracy of 92.2–93.8{\%} and 91.3–93.5{\%} in predicting at-risk and marginal students, respectively.},

In such colleges, the behavior of the student in the preparatory year determines which education path the student will join in the future. In this paper, an adaptive recommendation system is proposed for predicting a suitable education path(s) for a student in college preparatory year. The adaptability is achieved by automatically applying different data mining techniques for extracting relevant features and building a tailor-made model for each education path. The problem formulated as a multi-label multi-class binary classification problem and the dataset automatically translated into one-versus-all (for binary classification). As a case study, the proposed model is applied to predict student's academic performance in the faculty of engineering at AL-Azhar University. It recommends a suitable engineering department among seven engineering departments for each student based on his academic performance. The data of each department (i.e. educational program) is fed to the recommendation system. Then, the relevant set of features for each department is selected and a machine learning algorithm with the best performance is selected for the recommendation process of each department. The obtained results showed that the proposed model recommends the best machine learning algorithm (i.e. model) for each faculty department, find the relevant data that are important in the recommendation process and recommend the student with the suitable engineering department(s) with high accuracy.},

This is due to the various examinations and requirements that must be met to be qualified for admission among innumerable applicants. It is therefore imperative that after admission, students must pursue academic excellence to justify the opportunity given to them, and this will also improve their chances of success after graduation. In a university, some first-year students struggle because of cultural disadvantages, as well as their economic and social backgrounds. This has resulted in poor performance by some students and inevitably led to bad grades at graduation and some drop out of the university without graduating. Female students are often said to perform a bit poorer in terms of academic performance. This study is a comparative performance analysis of male and female students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), conducted using regression models. Trend analysis shows that in this case study, female students have a tendency to improve on their academic performance from their first to their final year. The highest R-squared value of 0.7069 was achieved based on a regression analysis of the performance of 1,093 female students.},

abstract = {This paper conducts a methodological research on the academic performance of online learners. This paper applies classification models commonly used in data mining algorithms, such as random forests based on decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks, K nearest neighbor algorithms, etc., combined with data mining tools S software and statistical analysis tools, and analyzes the University of Finance and Economics Tools scores of online learners in the class of 2019. It studies the important factors that affect the academic performance of college students' online learners, and uses these factors to predict students' academic performance. Based on the distance calculation method in mathematics, the article separately studied the application of Euclidean distance correlation analysis algorithm and correlation coefficient correlation algorithm in curriculum relevance, and compared several correlation algorithms. Experimental research results show that in the era of big data, learners will accumulate a large amount of structured and unstructured data during online learning. We can explore the influencing factors of online learners' academic performance through data mining technology, and we can also use machine learning to automatically learn from the data to the academic performance prediction model.},

abstract = {Digital data trails from disparate sources covering different aspects of student life are stored daily in most modern university campuses. However, it remains challenging to (i) combine these data to obtain a holistic view of a student, (ii) use these data to accurately predict academic performance, and (iii) use such predictions to promote positive student engagement with the university. To initially alleviate this problem, in this article, a model named Augmented Education (AugmentED) is proposed. In our study, (1) first, an experiment is conducted based on a real-world campus dataset of college students ( N =156 ) that aggregates multisource behavioral data covering not only online and offline learning but also behaviors inside and outside of the classroom. Specifically, to gain in-depth insight into the features leading to excellent or poor performance, metrics measuring the linear and nonlinear behavioral changes (e.g., regularity and stability) of campus lifestyles are estimated; furthermore, features representing dynamic changes in temporal lifestyle patterns are extracted by the means of long short-term memory (LSTM). (2) Second, machine learning-based classification algorithms are developed to predict academic performance. (3) Finally, visualized feedback enabling students (especially at-risk students) to potentially optimize their interactions with the university and achieve a study-life balance is designed. The experiments show that the AugmentED model can predict students' academic performance with high accuracy.},

Any educational Institute's (universities, colleges, schools) main goal is to increase the student's learning capabilities and their skills for their full contribution towards society. In These days, “student's learning process and skill development” research topic requires much-needed attention for the betterment of society. The student's performance depends on his/her learning ability and is influenced by many factors. In this paper, we analyze the different categories of student's leanings that are very fast, fast, moderate, and slow. For this, we conducted the training and tests and use the features likeability, knowledge level, reasoning, and core subject abilities for the 313 engineering students in AITAM, Tekkali, affiliated to JNTUK, India of 2017 to 2019. We gathered information about the personal, academic, cognitive level, and demographic data of students. In this experiment, we are conducting statistical analysis as well as classification of students into 4 types of learners and applying the different Machine Learning (ML) techniques, and choose the best ML algorithm for predicting students learning rates. This leads to conducting remedial classes with new teaching methods for moderate and slow learning students. The proposed paper accommodates the individual differences of the learners in terms of knowledge level, learning preferences, cognitive abilities, etc. For this, we apply 5 ML algorithms that are Naive Bayes, Classification Trees (CTs), k-NN, C4.5, and SVM. As per ML analysis, the k-Nearest Neighborhood (k-NN) algorithm is more efficient than other algorithms where the accuracy and prediction values are nearer to 100{\%}.},

Design/methodology/approach: A machine learning approach was used to develop a model based on secondary data obtained from students' information system in a Nigerian university. Findings: Results revealed that age is not a predictor for academic success (high CGPA); female students are 1.2 times more likely to have high CGPA compared to their male counterparts; students with high JAMB scores are more likely to achieve academic success, high CGPA and vice versa; students from affluent and developed regions are more likely to achieve academic success, high CGPA and vice versa; and students in Years 3 and 4 are more likely to achieve academic success, high CGPA. Originality/value: This predictive model serves as a classifier and useful strategy to mitigate failure, promote success and better manage resources in tertiary institutions.},

abstract = {Digital transformation is enabling institutions to enhance their processes by using data and technology. In education, digital transformation allows improving the learning experience as well as the institution processes. Within education 4.0, artificial intelligence applied to learning analytics is playing a key role for universities, particularly in the dropout issue, especially in STEM with the highest dropout rates. This is particularly relevant in the Latin American Higher Education scope, given the low labour productivity in these countries. In these countries, universities often have more demand than supply, and achieving an adequate balance between admission rates and dropout rates is a key issue. A high dropout rate harms the prestige of the university and damages students who were admitted without being adequate candidates. Understanding why students abandon their studies help to know what a university can do to avoid it. Data mining (DM) techniques can help discover the individual features that influence the dropout. There are different studies proposing models to predict dropout, and most are based on data that are not at the admission stage. We propose an approach that uses DM techniques to predict dropout based on data at the admission stage. We discover factors influencing dropout by a decision tree and association rules. We use a dataset of students of a computer science degree from a University in South America and achieve good performance when predicting dropout. The most attributes influencing dropout are the pre-grade performance in STEM subjects and the location of the city of residence.},

This problem can be solved with solid technical approaches, but blind brute-force data analysis approaches may prove insufficient to accurately predict grades, and even if they managed, instructors may need to further understand why and how these algorithms predict specific grades.

Thus, a section of studies on social networking site usage and multitasking strongly supports a negative consequence on students' academic performance. At the same time, other scholars have found little to no effect of social networking site usage on academic performance. The current study examined the association between the usage rate, the nature of use, usage in class, and level of exposure to a social networking site by students and their academic performance. Five-Hundred and Fifty (550) were sampled using a convenient sampling technique; an effort was made to address the divergent views on social media use and academic performance in the literature. Also, we predicted the student's GPA using a predictive framework based on Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithms. The outcome of the current study shows that the rate of social networking site usage and its use in class partially affects students' academic performance.},

Students are facing various difficulties in courses like 'Programming' and 'Data Structures' through undergraduate programs, which is why failure and dropout rates in these courses are high. Therefore, EDM is used to analyze students' data gathered from various educational settings to predict students' academic performance, which would help them to achieve better results in their future courses. The main goal of this paper is to explore the efficiency of deep learning in the field of EDM, especially in predicting students' academic performance, to identify students at risk of failure. A dataset collected from a public 4-year university was used in this study to develop predictive models to predict students' academic performance of upcoming courses given their grades in the previous courses of the first academic year using a deep neural network (DNN), decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, logistic regression, support vector classifier, and K-nearest neighbor. In addition, we made a comparison between various resampling methods to solve the imbalanced dataset problem, such as SMOTE, ADASYN, ROS, and SMOTE-ENN. From the experimental results, it is observed that the proposed DNN model can predict students' performance in a data structure course and can also identify students at risk of failure at an early stage of a semester with an accuracy of 89{\%}, which is higher than models like decision tree, logistic regression, support vector classifier, and K-nearest neighbor.},

One simple wrong decision made while Shortlisting University without the knowledge of university ranking by a student can ruin an entire year of hard work and success. A poor university choice may conflict with the student's inner gift and talent, wasting invested time and can cause confusion in choosing the right path and directions. Especially the student who is opting for a master's degree based on their G R E / T O F E L score face real difficulty in choosing different research-based universities that need a high score in these exams. This study can help the student to take a measurable step towards selecting. Our study focuses on using analytics to propose a model for predicting the chance of admissions. This paper attempts to define different regression models and predict students' chances of getting admissions.

Further, our study explores two different sampling methods naming random forest and cross-validation sampling. All these regression methods are used to predict students' chance of admitting to the University of their Interest based on their graduate performance. The best regression method is used to predict new unseen data.},

abstract = {The Learning Analytics community has recently paid particular attention to early predict learners' performance. An established approach entails training classification models from past learner-related data in order to predict the exam success rate of a student well before the end of the course. Early predictions allow teachers to put in place targeted actions, e.g., supporting at-risk students to avoid exam failures or course dropouts. Although several machine learning and data mining solutions have been proposed to learn accurate predictors from past data, the interpretability and explainability of the best performing models is often limited. Therefore, in most cases, the reasons behind classifiers' decisions remain unclear. This paper proposes an Explainable Learning Analytics solution to analyze learner-generated data acquired by our technical university, which relies on a blended learning model. It adopts classification techniques to early predict the success rate of about 5000 students who were enrolled in the first year courses of our university. It proposes to apply associative classifiers at different time points and to explore the characteristics of the models that led to assign pass or fail success rates. Thanks to their inherent interpretability, associative models can be manually explored by domain experts with the twofold aim at validating classifier outcomes through local rule-based explanations and identifying at-risk/successful student profiles by interpreting the global rule-based model. The results of an in-depth empirical evaluation demonstrate that associative models (i) perform as good as the best performing classification models, and (ii) give relevant insights into the per-student success rate assignments.},

abstract = {Background: Despite powerful efforts to maximize nursing school enrollment, schools and colleges of nursing are faced with high rates of attrition and low rates of completion. Early identification of at-risk students and the factors associated with graduation outcomes are the main foci for the studies that have addressed attrition and completion rates in nursing programs. Machine learning has been shown to perform better in prediction tasks than traditional statistical methods. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to identify adequate models that predict, early in a students career, if an undergraduate nursing student will graduate within six college years. In addition, factors related to successful graduation were to be identified using several of the algorithms. Design: Predictions were made at five time points: the beginning of the first, second, third, fourth years, and the end of the sixth year. Fourteen scenarios were built for each machine learning algorithm through the combinations of different variable sections and time points. Settings: College of Nursing in a private university in an urban Midwest city, USA. Participants: Seven hundred and seventy-three full time, first time, and degree-seeking students who enrolled from 2004 through 2012 in a traditional 4-year baccalaureate nursing program. Methods: Eight popular machine learning algorithms were chosen for model construction and comparison. In addition, a stacked ensemble method was introduced in the study to boost the accuracy and reduce the variance of prediction. Results: Using one year of college academic performance, the graduation outcome can be correctly predicted for over 80{\%} of the students. The prediction accuracy can reach 90{\%} after the second college year and 99{\%} after the third year. Among all the variables, cumulative grade points average (GPA) and nursing course GPA are the most influential factors for predicting graduation. Conclusions: This study provides a potential mode of data-based tracking system for nursing students during their entire baccalaureate program. This tracking system can serve a large number of students automatically to provide customized evaluation on the dropout risk students and enhance the ability of a school or college to more strategically design school-based prevention and interventional services.},

abstract = {Early and precisely predicting the students' dropout based on available educational data belongs to the widespread research topic of the learning analytics research field. Despite the amount of already realized research, the progress is not significant and persists on all educational data levels. Even though various features have already been researched, there is still an open question, which features can be considered appropriate for different machine learning classifiers applied to the typical scarce set of educational data at the e-learning course level. Therefore, the main goal of the research is to emphasize the importance of the data understanding, data gathering phase, stress the limitations of the available datasets of educational data, compare the performance of several machine learning classifiers, and show that also a limited set of features, which are available for teachers in the e-learning course, can predict student's dropout with sufficient accuracy if the performance metrics are thoroughly considered. The data collected from four academic years were analyzed. The features selected in this study proved to be applicable in predicting course completers and non-completers. The prediction accuracy varied between 77 and 93{\%} on unseen data from the next academic year. In addition to the frequently used performance metrics, the comparison of machine learning classifiers homogeneity was analyzed to overcome the impact of the limited size of the dataset on obtained high values of performance metrics. The results showed that several machine learning algorithms could be successfully applied to a scarce dataset of educational data. Simultaneously, classification performance metrics should be thoroughly considered before deciding to deploy the best performance classification model to predict potential dropout cases and design beneficial intervention mechanisms.},

In last year, the world has been turned increasingly to online education due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic; therefore, improving this education system became an urgent matter. Online learning systems are a primal environment for acquiring educational data which can be from different sources, especially academic institutions. These data can be mainly used to analyze and extract utilizable information to help in understanding university students' performance and identifying factors that affect it. To extract some meaningful information from these large volumes of data, academic organizations must mine the data with high accuracy. In this work, three different real datasets were selected, pre-processed, cleaned, and filtered for applying support vector machine (SVM) with multilayer perceptron kernel (MLP kernel) and optimize its parameters using simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to improve the objective function value. While examining the search space, SA has the advantage of escaping from local minima since it offers the chance for accepting the worse neighbor as a solution in a controlled manner. The results show that the designed system can determine the best SVM parameters using SA and therefore presents better model evaluation.},

Predicting and analyzing the performance of the student is essential to assist educators in identifying weaknesses and enhancing the academic scores. However, achieving accurate predictions is challenging due to huge amount of educational data. The main reason behind this, is the lack of research on exploring different prediction methods and key attributes that influence the student's academic performance. Hence, this systematic review intends to explore the current machine learning methods and attributes used in predicting the student's performance. Several online databases were used to perform a systematic search of data-driven studies. The analysis and assessment of 30 selected articles revealed five main prediction methods: artificial neural networks (ANNs), decision trees, support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and na{\"{i}}ve Bayes. Our findings revealed that the ANN method has the best performance with a high level of accuracy. Demographic, academic, family/personal and internal assessment were found to be the most frequently used attributes in prediction the student performance.},

The findings highlight the student performance based on their demographic status and use of university resources such as financial aid. College campuses should not only increase current resources but also raise awareness of current resources and make them more accessible (e.g., easier to apply or automatic applications). This is especially important for some demographics such as Hispanic first-generation students. Background: Higher education institutions are facing retention and graduation problems. One way to improve this is by understanding why students are not academically successful. Research Questions: In this study, demographic information and past academic records were analyzed to understand patterns of student success. Methodology: A cluster analysis was conducted to understand groups of students based on academic performance and demographic information. Examples of these factors are enrollment status, financial status, first-generation status, housing status, and transfer status. For the purpose of getting more accurate results, the students were separated into two different groups according to their admission status: 1) freshman and 2) transfer. Findings: The results indicate Hispanic, first-generation, low-income students are not likely to apply for financial aid although they are eligible. They have lower GPA and take fewer units per semester than other students. This can cause delayed graduation and accumulating more debt.},

As education moves from conventional to online instruction, student performance is a key concern for management because numerous factors could affect learning. This study proposes to evaluate the attributes of distance learning that could affect student performance and then adopt a classification algorithm to recommend improvements to higher education organizations. The relevant educational data for the algorithm were gathered in the 2020-2021 academic year from student surveys in four classes at the College of Sciences and Arts at Qassim University (Unaizah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia). The data were then subjected to decision tree analysis, which generated a model based on 66 classification rules. The results of the present study showed that the model developed using data-mining rule-based classifiers is efficient for predicting a student's final course grade. In order to evaluate the accurate of the correctly classified instances; three different classification methods were tested, i.e., Bayes Net-D, naive Bayes, and J48. As a percentage of the correctly identified cases using the three separate algorithms, the overall accuracies of the evaluation results were 90.2439{\%}, 87.8049{\%} and 95.0617 {\%} respectively.},

abstract = {Online learning platforms such as Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs), and Learning Management Systems (LMS) facilitate thousands or even millions of students to learn according to their interests without spatial and temporal constraints. Besides many advantages, online learning platforms face several challenges such as students' lack of interest, high dropouts, low engagement, students' self-regulated behavior, and compelling students to take responsibility for settings their own goals. In this study, we propose a predictive model that analyzes the problems faced by at-risk students, subsequently, facilitating instructors for timely intervention to persuade students to increase their study engagements and improve their study performance. The predictive model is trained and tested using various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms to characterize the learning behavior of students according to their study variables. The performance of various ML algorithms is compared by using accuracy, precision, support, and f-score. The ML algorithm that gives the best result in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, support, and f-score metric is ultimately selected for creating the predictive model at different percentages of course length. The predictive model can help instructors in identifying at-risk students early in the course for timely intervention thus avoiding student dropouts. Our results showed that students' assessment scores, engagement intensity i.e. clickstream data, and time-dependent variables are important factors in online learning.

Encouragingly, our model superseded the baseline logistic regression and artificial neural networks by 18.48{\%} and 12.31{\%}, respectively, with 95.23{\%} learning accuracy. We demonstrated that the clickstream data generated due to the students' interaction with the online learning platforms can be evaluated at a week-wise granularity to improve the early prediction of at-risk students. Interestingly, our model can predict pass/fail class with around 90{\%} accuracy within the first 10 weeks of student interaction in a virtual learning environment (VLE). A contribution of our research is an informed approach to advanced higher education decision-making towards sustainable education. It is a bold effort for student-centric policies, promoting the trust and the loyalty of students in courses and programs.},

abstract = {Several challenges are associated with e-learning systems, the most significant of which is the lack of student motivation in various course activities and for various course materials. In this study, we used machine learning (ML) algorithms to identify low-engagement students in a social science course at the Open University (OU) to assess the effect of engagement on student performance. The input variables of the study included highest education level, final results, score on the assessment, and the number of clicks on virtual learning environment (VLE) activities, which included dataplus, forumng, glossary, oucollaborate, oucontent, resources, subpages, homepage, and URL during the first course assessment. The output variable was the student level of engagement in the various activities. To predict low-engagement students, we applied several ML algorithms to the dataset. Using these algorithms, trained models were first obtained; then, the accuracy and kappa values of the models were compared. The results demonstrated that the J48, decision tree, JRIP, and gradient-boosted classifiers exhibited better performance in terms of the accuracy, kappa value, and recall compared to the other tested models. Based on these findings, we developed a dashboard to facilitate instructor at the OU. These models can easily be incorporated into VLE systems to help instructors evaluate student engagement during VLE courses with regard to different activities and materials and to provide additional interventions for students in advance of their final exam. Furthermore, this study examined the relationship between student engagement and the course assessment score.},

Students who show high levels of engagement appear less likely to be at risk of failing, and how engaged a student is in their online experience can be characterized as factors contributing to their social presence. Social presence begins with teacher-student and student-student interaction in online courses. Fortunately, student interaction data can be gleaned from learning management systems, used to model and predict at-risk students at an early stage. This research addresses an existing model for predicting at-risk students to test a previous hypothesis that a holiday effect is a contributor for failure. A new analysis then presents an alternative approach, one that tests the frequency of student interaction rather than amount of interaction as a preferable indicator.},

abstract = {Online learning has been adopted rapidly by educational institutions and organizations. Despite its many advantages, including 24/7 access, high flexibility, rich content, and low cost, online learning suffers from high dropout rates that hamper pedagogical and economic goal outcomes. Enhanced student dropout prediction tools would help providers proactively detect students at risk of leaving and identify factors that they might address to help students continue their learning experience. Therefore, this study seeks to improve student dropout predictions, with three main contributions. First, it benchmarks a recently proposed logit leaf model (LLM) algorithm against eight other algorithms, using a real-life data set of 10,554 students of a global subscription-based online learning provider. The LLM outperforms all other methods in finding a balance between predictive performance and comprehensibility. Second, a new multilevel informative visualization of the LLM adds novel benefits, relative to a standard LLM visualization. Third, this research specifies the impacts of student demographics; classroom characteristics; and academic, cognitive, and behavioral engagement variables on student dropout. In reviewing LLM segments, these results show that different insights emerge for various student segments with different learning patterns. This notable result can be used to personalize student retention campaigns.},

In this study, we applied educational data mining to explore the learning behaviors in data generated by students in a blended learning course. The experimental data were collected from two classes of Python programming related courses for first-year students in a university in northern Taiwan. During the semester, high-risk learners could be predicted accurately by data generated from the blended educational environment. The f1-score of the random forest model was 0.83, which was higher than the f1-score of logistic regression and decision tree. The model built in this study could be extrapolated to other courses to predict students' learning performance, where the F1-score was 0.77. Furthermore, we used machine learning and symmetry-based learning algorithms to explore learning behaviors. By using the hierarchical clustering heat map, this study could define the students' learning patterns including the positive interactive group, stable learning group, positive teaching material group, and negative learning group. These groups also corresponded with the student conscious questionnaire. With the results of this research, teachers can use the mid-term forecasting system to find high-risk groups during the semester and remedy their learning behaviors in the future.},

For both classification and regression tasks, the overall highest precision was obtained with artificial neural networks by feeding the student engagement data and past performance data, while the usage of demographic data did not show significant influence on the precision of predictions. To exploit the full potential of the student exam performance prediction, it was concluded that adequate data acquisition functionalities and the student interaction with the learning environment is a prerequisite to ensure sufficient amount of data for analysis.},

However, it is remarkable that a very limited number of studies use information about the assignments submitted by students as influential factor to predict their academic achievement. This paper aims to explore the real importance of assignment information for solving students' performance prediction in distance learning and evaluate the beneficial effect of including this information. We investigate and compare this factor and its potential from two information representation approaches: the traditional representation based on single instances and a more flexible representation based on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), focus on handle weakly labeled data. A comparative study is carried out using the Open University Learning Analytics dataset, one of the most important public datasets in education provided by one of the greatest online universities of United Kingdom. The study includes a wide set of different types of machine learning algorithms addressed from the two data representation commented, showing that algorithms using only information about assignments with a representation based on MIL can outperform more than 20{\%} the accuracy with respect to a representation based on single instance learning. Thus, it is concluded that applying an appropriate representation that eliminates the sparseness of data allows to show the relevance of a factor, such as the assignments submitted, not widely used to date to predict students' academic performance. Moreover, a comparison with previous works on the same dataset and problem shows that predictive models based on MIL using only assignments information obtain competitive results compared to previous studies that include other factors to predict students performance.},

abstract = {Background: Stress-related mental health problems are one of the most common causes of the burden in university students worldwide. Many studies have been conducted to predict the prevalence of stress among university students, however most of these analyses were predominantly performed using the basic logistic regression (LR) model. As an alternative, we used the advanced machine learning (ML) approaches for detecting significant risk factors and to predict the prevalence of stress among Bangladeshi university students. Methods: This prevalence study surveyed 355 students from twenty-eight different Bangladeshi universities using questions concerning anthropometric measurements, academic, lifestyles, and health-related information, which referred to the perceived stress status of the respondents (yes or no). Boruta algorithm was used in determining the significant prognostic factors of the prevalence of stress. Prediction models were built using decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and LR, and their performances were evaluated using parameters of confusion matrix, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, and k-fold cross-validation techniques. Results: One-third of university students reported stress within the last 12 months. Students' pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, sleep status, smoking status, and academic background were selected as the important features for predicting the prevalence of stress. Evaluated performance revealed that the highest performance observed from RF (accuracy = 0.8972, precision = 0.9241, sensitivity = 0.9250, specificity = 0.8148, area under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0.8715, k-fold accuracy = 0.8983) and the lowest from LR (accuracy = 0.7476, precision = 0.8354, sensitivity = 0.8250, specificity = 0.5185, AUC = 0.7822, k-fold accuracy = 07713) and SVM with polynomial kernel of degree 2 (accuracy = 0.7570, precision = 0.7975, sensitivity = 0.8630, specificity = 0.5294, AUC = 0.7717, k-fold accuracy = 0.7855). Overall, the RF model performs better and authentically predicted stress compared with other ML techniques, including individual and interaction effects of predictors. Conclusion: The machine learning framework can be detected the significant prognostic factors and predicted this psychological problem more accurately, thereby helping the policy-makers, stakeholders, and families to understand and prevent this serious crisis by improving policy-making strategies, mental health promotion, and establishing effective university counseling services.},

Currently in Malaysia, the lack of existing system to analyze and monitor the student progress and performance is not being addressed. There are two main reasons of why this is happening. First, the study on existing prediction methods is still insufficient to identify the most suitable methods for predicting the performance of students in Malaysian institutions. Second is due to the lack of investigations on the factors affecting students achievements in particular courses within Malaysian context. Therefore, a systematical literature review on predicting student performance by using data mining techniques is proposed to improve students achievements. The main objective of this paper is to provide an overview on the data mining techniques that have been used to predict students performance. This paper also focuses on how the prediction algorithm can be used to identify the most important attributes in a students data. We could actually improve students achievement and success more effectively in an efficient way using educational data mining techniques.

This study investigated the relationship between students' academic success and online interaction and participation and explored their class attendance (synchronous virtual classes and/or watching the recorded virtual classes) in the online study mode of an enabling program at Southern Cross University in Australia. The Preparing for Success at SCU Program equips students with study skills for success at university. The data were retrieved from usage information data provided by the Blackboard Learn learning management system. The results show that it is important for students to attend class, but it does not necessarily make a difference whether students attend synchronous virtual classes or watch the recordings of the virtual classes. A significant relationship was found between academic success and the number of hours students participated in and interacted with the online learning system. Academic success may be increased by providing various options for students to participate and interact online, and to attend classes synchronously or asynchronously. The flexibility of online education can enable students to be successful in their studies. The inclusion of varied activities is therefore recommended to increase academic success in online education. Implications for practice or policy: • Online students' academic success may be increased by providing various options for students to participate and interact online, and to attend virtual classes synchronously and/or asynchronously. • Course designers and educators should include varied activities to provide online students with multiple opportunities to interact and participate synchronously and/or asynchronously. • University educators should record synchronous virtual classes and make the recorded virtual classes available to students.},

Along with the explosive increase of data and information, incremental learning ability has become more and more important for machine learning approaches. The online algorithms try to forget irrelevant information instead of synthesizing all available information (as opposed to classic batch learning algorithms). Nowadays, combining classifiers is proposed as a new direction for the improvement of the classification accuracy. However, most ensemble algorithms operate in batch mode. Therefore a better proposal is an online ensemble of classifiers that combines an incremental version of Naive Bayes, the 1-NN and the WINNOW algorithms using the voting methodology.

Multiple factors influence the performance in non-linear ways; thus making this field more attractive to the researchers. The widespread availability of e ducational datasets further catalyse this interestingness, especially in online learning. Although several EDM surveys are available in the literature, we could find only a few specific surveys on student performance analysis and prediction. These specific surveys are limited in nature and primarily focus on studies that try to identify possible predictor or model student performance. However, the previous works do not address the temporal aspect of prediction. Moreover, we could not find any such specific survey which focuses only on classroom-based education. In this paper, we present a systematic review of EDM studies on student performance in classroom learning. It focuses on identifying the predictors, methods used for such identification, time and aim of prediction. It is significantly the first systematic survey of EDM studies that consider only classroom learning and focuses on the temporal aspect as well. This paper presents a review of 140 studies in this area. The meta-analysis indicates that the researchers achieve significant prediction efficiency during the tenure of the course. However, performance prediction before course commencement needs special attention.},

The approach has been applied in a case-study which has been performed in the context of an undergraduate Computer Science curriculum offered by the University of Thessaly in Greece. Students involved in the case study were initially grouped based on the similarity of specific education-related factors and metrics. Using the K-Means algorithm, our clustering experiments revealed the presence of three coherent clusters of students. Subsequently, the discovered clusters were utilized to train prediction models for addressing each particular cluster of students individually. In this regard, two machine learning models were trained for every cluster of students in order to predict the time to degree completion and student enrollment in the offered educational programs. The developed models are claimed to produce predictions with relatively high accuracy. Finally, the paper discusses the potential usefulness of the clustering-aided approach for learning analytics in Higher Education.},

abstract = {This study sought to identify significant behavioral indicators of learning using learning management system (LMS) data regarding online course achievement. Because self-regulated learning is critical to success in online learning, measures reflecting self-regulated learning were included to examine the relationship between LMS data measures and course achievement. Data were collected from 530 college students who took an online course. The results demonstrated that students' regular study, late submissions of assignments, number of sessions (the frequency of course logins), and proof of reading the course information packets significantly predicted their course achievement. These findings verify the importance of self-regulated learning and reveal the advantages of using measures related to meaningful learning behaviors rather than simple frequency measures. Furthermore, the measures collected in the middle of the course significantly predicted course achievement, and the findings support the potential for early prediction using learning performance data. Several implications of these findings are discussed.},

abstract = {Finding a solution to the problem of student retention is an often-required task across Higher Education. Most often managers and academics alike rely on intuition and experience to identify the potential risk students and factors. This paper examines the literature surrounding current methods and measures in use in Learning Analytics. We find that while tools are available, they do not focus on earliest possible identification of struggling students. Our work defines a new descriptive statistic for student attendance and applies modern machine learning tools and techniques to create a predictive model. We demonstrate how students can be identified as early as week 3 (of the Fall semester) with approximately 97{\%} accuracy. We, furthermore, situate this result within an appropriate pedagogical context to support its use as part of a more comprehensive student support mechanism.},

abstract = {Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) have increased immensely in their popularity worldwide. In the UK, every higher educational institution is using one or more VLEs to assist teaching. Because of the growing number of online interactions with these environments, students are leaving trails of information regarding their online activities. This data is descriptive of students' behavior and has the potential of becoming a goldmine of educational data. This research is a case study of applying data mining and machine learning algorithms to the data resulting from the usage of Moodle at the University of Essex in the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering. It was the first department to introduce Moodle in 2006. Moreover, with every year an increasing number of academics have a preference for using Moodle as a tool for sharing and exchanging information within a course. The resulting Moodle data is enriched by that available from the students' records. The methodology discussed explores the relationship between students' performance and Moodle usage. The process for mining e-learning data is described in detail, starting with the preprocessing step to the evaluation and discussion of results. The approach uses clustering to discover the natural groupings of patterns in the dataset.},

abstract = {Prediction of student performance is one of the most important subjects of educational data mining. Artificial neural networks are seen to be an effective tool in predicting student performance in e-learning environments. In the studies carried out with artificial neural networks, performance predictions based on student scores are generally made, but students' use of learning management system is not focused. In this study, performances of 3518 university students, who studying and actively participating in a learning management system, were tried to be predicted by artificial neural networks in terms of gender, content score, time spent on the content, number of entries to content, homework score, number of attendance to live sessions, total time spent in live sessions, number of attendance to archived courses and total time spent in archived courses variables. Since it is difficult to interpret how much input variables in artificial neural networks contribute to predicting output variables, these networks are called black boxes. Also, in this study the amount of contribution of input variables on the prediction of output variable was also examined. The artificial neural network created as a result of the study makes a prediction with an accuracy of 80.47{\%}. Finally, it was found that the variables of number of attendance to the live classes, the number of attendance to archived courses and the time spent in the content contributed most to the prediction of the output variable.},

abstract = {In the current study interaction data of students in an online learning setting was used to research whether the academic performance of students at the end of term could be predicted in the earlier weeks. The study was carried out with 76 second-year university students registered in a Computer Hardware course. The study aimed to answer two principle questions: which algorithms and features best predict the end of term academic performance of students by comparing different classification algorithms and pre-processing techniques and whether or not academic performance can be predicted in the earlier weeks using these features and the selected algorithm. The results of the study indicated that the kNN algorithm accurately predicted unsuccessful students at the end of term with a rate of 89{\%}. When findings were examined regarding the analysis of data obtained in weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, and 14 to predict whether the end-of-term academic performance of students could be predicted in the earlier weeks, it was observed that students who were unsuccessful at the end of term could be predicted with a rate of 74{\%} in as short as 3 weeks' time. The findings obtained from this study are important for the determination of features for early warning systems that can be developed for online learning systems and as indicators of student success. At the same time, it will aid researchers in the selection of algorithms and pre-processing techniques in the analysis of educational data.},

In keeping with this, identifying the factors affecting the students' performance in higher education, especially by using predictive data mining techniques, is still in short supply. This field of research is usually identified as educational data mining. Hence, the main aim of this study is to identify the most commonly studied factors that affect the students' performance, as well as, the most common data mining techniques applied to identify these factors. In this study, 36 research articles out of a total of 420 from 2009 to 2018 were critically reviewed and analyzed by applying a systematic literature review approach. The results showed that the most common factors are grouped under four main categories, namely students' previous grades and class performance, students' e-Learning activity, students' demographics, and students' social information. Additionally, the results also indicated that the most common data mining techniques used to predict and classify students' factors are decision trees, Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes classifiers, and artificial neural networks.},

During the pandemic, with the transition to compulsory distance learning in higher education, it has become even more important to identify these students and make instructional interventions to avoid leaving them behind. This goal can be achieved by new data mining techniques and machine learning methods. This study took both the synchronous and asynchronous activity characteristics of students into account to identify students at risk of academic failure during the pandemic. Additionally, this study proposes an optimal ensemble model predicting students at risk using a combination of relevant machine learning algorithms. Performances of over two thousand university students were predicted with an ensemble model in terms of gender, degree, number of downloaded lecture notes and course materials, total time spent in online sessions, number of attendances, and quiz score. Asynchronous learning activities were found more determinant than synchronous ones. The proposed ensemble model made a good prediction with a specificity of 90.34{\%}. Thus, practitioners are suggested to monitor and organize training activities accordingly.},

abstract = {Educational data mining has received considerable attention in the last few years. Many data mining techniques are proposed to extract the hidden knowledge from educational data. The extracted knowledge helps the institutions to improve their teaching methods and learning process. All these improvements lead to enhance the performance of the students and the overall educational outputs. In this paper, we propose a new student's performance prediction model based on data mining techniques with new data attributes/features, which are called student's behavioral features. These type of features are related to the learner's interactivity with the e-learning management system. The performance of student's predictive model is evaluated by set of classifiers, namely; Artificial Neural Network, Na{\"{i}}ve Bayesian and Decision tree. In addition, we applied ensemble methods to improve the performance of these classifiers. We used Bagging, Boosting and Random Forest (RF), which are the common ensemble methods used in the literature. The obtained results reveal that there is a strong relationship between learner's behaviors and their academic achievement. The accuracy of the proposed model using behavioral features achieved up to 22.1{\%} improvement comparing to the results when removing such features and it achieved up to 25.8{\%} accuracy improvement using ensemble methods. By testing the model using newcomer students, the achieved accuracy is more than 80{\%}. This result proves the reliability of the proposed model},

abstract = {Educational Data Mining (EDM) is a discipline related to the development of methods that allow the extraction of knowledge from academic, socioeconomic data, and learning analytics. The information obtained is used in decision-making to improve the indexes of academic performance, educational quality, desertion and student procrastination, among others. The EDM uses techniques of Statistical Analysis, machine learning and data mining within the framework (setting) of a development methodology such as Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM), and Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, Assess (SEMMA) or variants thereof. A drawback that we have to face mainly in South America is the need to have data scientists who participate in determining stages of a conventional EDM model that applies machine learning. To minimize this inconvenience, a EDM model applied in the university environment is proposed that uses Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and Machine Learning Interpretability (IML) techniques. These two techniques will allow us to automate stages for data pre-processing, choice of machine learning models, choice of the best hyperparameters for the models, and interpretation of the results and the characteristics that influenced in the results, these last very important from the legal and ethical point of view, because not only must the model classify or predict with a good result, but it must also be able to inform us how it reached the conclusion.},

abstract = {The purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of formative assessment and learning style on student achievement in a Web-based learning environment. A quasi-experimental research design was used. Participants were 455 seventh grade students from 12 classes of six junior high schools. A Web-based course, named BioCAL, combining three different formative assessment strategies was developed. The formative assessment strategies included Formative Assessment Module of the Web-Based Assessment and Test Analysis system (FAM-WATA) (with six Web-based formative assessment strategies), Normal Module of Web-Based Assessment and Test Analysis system (N-WATA) (only with partial Web-based formative assessment strategy) and Paper and Pencil Test (PPT) (without Web-based formative assessment strategy). Subjects were tested using Kolb's Learning Style Inventory, and assigned randomly by class into three groups. Each group took Web-based courses using one of the formative assessment strategies. Pre- and post-achievement testing was carried out. A one-way ANCOVA analysis showed that both learning style and formative assessment strategy are significant factors affecting student achievement in a Web-based learning environment. However, there is no interaction between these two factors. A post hoc comparison showed that performances of the FAM-WATA group are higher than the N-WATA and PPT groups. Learners with a 'Diverger' learning style performed best followed by, 'Assimilator', 'Accommodator', and 'Converger', respectively. Finally, FAM-WATA group students are satisfied with six strategies of the FAM-WATA. {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

The findings indicate that most of the data analytics techniques have successfully identified and predicted at-risk students and various types of data are determined as attributes in predicting at-risk students. Finally, further research should be conducted to identify and predict at-risk students, since there are diverse students in online learning who have different demands, and interventions should be developed to tackle the problems faced by at-risk students in order to enhance their learning performances.},

abstract = {With the rapid advancements in technology, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have become the most popular form of online educational delivery, largely due to the removal of geographical and financial barriers for participants. A large number of learners globally enrol in such courses. Despite the flexible accessibility, results indicate that the completion rate is quite low. Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics are emerging fields of research that aim to enhance the delivery of education through the application of various statistical and machine learning approaches. An extensive literature survey indicates that no significant research is available within the area of MOOC data analysis, in particular considering the behavioural patterns of users. In this paper, therefore, two sets of features, based on learner behavioural patterns, were compared in terms of their suitability for predicting the course outcome of learners participating in MOOCs. Our Exploratory Data Analysis demonstrates that there is strong correlation between click stream actions and successful learner outcomes. Various Machine Learning algorithms have been applied to enhance the accuracy of classifier models. Simulation results from our investigation have shown that Random Forest achieved viable performance for our prediction problem, obtaining the highest performance of the models tested. Conversely, Linear Discriminant Analysis achieved the lowest relative performance, though represented only a marginal reduction in performance relative to the Random Forest.},

abstract = {The data about high students' failure rates in introductory programming courses have been alarming many educators, raising a number of important questions regarding prediction aspects. In this paper, we present a comparative study on the effectiveness of educational data mining techniques to early predict students likely to fail in introductory programming courses. Although several works have analyzed these techniques to identify students' academic failures, our study differs from existing ones as follows: (i) we investigate the effectiveness of such techniques to identify students likely to fail at early enough stage for action to be taken to reduce the failure rate; (ii) we analyse the impact of data preprocessing and algorithms fine-tuning tasks, on the effectiveness of the mentioned techniques. In our study we evaluated the effectiveness of four prediction techniques on two different and independent data sources on introductory programming courses available from a Brazilian Public University: one comes from distance education and the other from on-campus. The results showed that the techniques analyzed in our study are able to early identify students likely to fail, the effectiveness of some of these techniques is improved after applying the data preprocessing and/or algorithms fine-tuning, and the support vector machine technique outperforms the other ones in a statistically significant way.},

abstract = {With the rise of big data analytics, learning analytics has become a major trend for improving the quality of education. Learning analytics is a methodology for helping students to succeed in the classroom; the principle is to predict student's academic performance at an early stage and thus provide them with timely assistance. Accordingly, this study used multiple linear regression (MLR), a popular method of predicting students' academic performance, to establish a prediction model. Moreover, we combined MLR with principal component analysis (PCA) to improve the predictive accuracy of the model. TraditionalMLR has certain drawbacks; specifically, the coefficient of determination (R2) and mean square error (MSE) measures and the quantile-quantile plot (Q-Q plot) technique cannot evaluate the predictive performance and accuracy of MLR. Therefore, we propose predictive MSE (pMSE) and predictive mean absolute percentage correction (pMAPC) measures for determining the predictive performance and accuracy of the regression model, respectively. Analysis results revealed that the proposed model for predicting students' academic performance could obtain optimal pMSE and pMAPC values by using six components obtained from PCA.},

abstract = {Modeling student learning and further predicting the performance is a well-established task in online learning and is crucial to personalized education by recommending different learning resources to different students based on their needs. Interactive online question pools (e.g., educational game platforms), an important component of online education, have become increasingly popular in recent years. However, most existing work on student performance prediction targets at online learning platforms with a well-structured curriculum, predefined question order and accurate knowledge tags provided by domain experts. It remains unclear how to conduct student performance prediction in interactive online question pools without such well-organized question orders or knowledge tags by experts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to boost student performance prediction in interactive online question pools by further considering student interaction features and the similarity between questions. Specifically, we introduce new features (e.g., think time, first attempt, and first drag-and-drop) based on student mouse movement trajectories to delineate students' problem-solving details. In addition, heterogeneous information network is applied to integrating students' historical problem-solving information on similar questions, enhancing student performance predictions on a new question. We evaluate the proposed approach on the dataset from a real-world interactive question pool using four typical machine learning models. The result shows that our approach can achieve a much higher accuracy for student performance prediction in interactive online question pools than the traditional way of only using the statistical features (e.g., students' historical question scores) in various models. We further discuss the performance consistency of our approach across different prediction models and question classes, as well as the importance of the proposed interaction features in detail. {\&}copy; 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract = {A number of studies have demonstrated links between linguistic knowledge and performance in math. Studies examining these links in first language speakers of English have traditionally relied on correlational analyses between linguistic knowledge tests and standardized math tests. For second language (L2) speakers, the majority of studies have compared math performance between proficient and non-proficient speakers of English. In this study, we take a novel approach and examine the linguistic features of student language while they are engaged in collaborative problem solving within an on-line math tutoring system. We transcribe the students' speech and use natural language processing tools to extract linguistic information related to text cohesion, lexical sophistication, and sentiment. Our criterion variables are individuals' pretest and posttest math performance scores. In addition to examining relations between linguistic features of student language production and math scores, we also control for a number of non-linguistic factors including gender, age, grade, school, and content focus (procedural versus conceptual). Linear mixed effect modeling indicates that non-linguistic factors are not predictive of math scores. However, linguistic features related to cohesion affect and lexical proficiency explained approximately 30{\%} of the variance (R2 =.303) in the math scores.},

abstract = {This study is focused on the relationships among learning styles, participation types, and learning performance for programming language learning supported by an online forum. Kolb's learning style inventory was used in this study to determine a learner's learning type: 'Diverger', 'Assimilator', 'Converger', and 'Accommodator'. Social Learning Theory was also used to define four participation types. These types in turn were used to describe the learning associated with the use of online forums: 'Replier', 'Asker', 'Watcher', and 'No activity'. A total of 144 students participated in this experiment as part of a half semester ASP.NET programming language learning courses. The course contained an online forum for supporting the students' social activities and participation. In this study, 'learning score' and 'satisfaction' were used to measure learning performance. The results of this study were the following: (1) different learning styles were associated with significantly different learning scores and that the 'Accommodator' style was associated with superior learning scores; (2) participation types were also associated with significantly different learning scores and that the 'Replier' type is associated with superior learning scores; (3) learning satisfaction is not significantly different among the different learning styles or different participation types, but the average is significantly higher than average values (3.5) of 7-point Likert scale; (4) there is no significant association between learning styles and participation types. Explanations and discussions of these results are offered. Based on the results of this study, we propose that programming language learning, supported with online forums and students' active participation, increases learning performance as measured by student learning scores. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this study we proposed a web-based programming assisted system for cooperation (WPASC) and we also designed one learning activity for facilitating students' cooperative programming learning. The aim of this study was to investigate cooperative programming learning behavior of students and its relationship with learning performance. Students' opinions and perceptions toward learning activity and the WPASC were also investigated. The results of this study revealed that most of students perceived that learning activity and the WPASC were useful for cooperative programming learning. Students' learning behavior during cooperative programming learning activity was classified into six different categories and we found that learning behavior has relationship with learning performance. Students from completely independent, self-improving using assistance, confident after enlightenment and imitating categories performed well due to their effective and motivated learning behavior. However, students from performing poorly without assistance and plagiarizing categories performed the worse; the former could not get assistance at all and the later had no learning motivation. The results also showed that students' learning behavior may have increasing, decreasing and no transition during problems solving. Therefore, performing poorly without assistance and plagiarizing learning behavior and decreasing transition or no transition in learning behavior should be identified right after completing a programming problem. Then the instructor should intervene into learning behavior in order to change it into more effective for learning. Besides, more incentives need to be given for increasing students' learning motivation and posting solutions and feedback by students at the early stage of a problem solving period. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In prior research, we explored the relationship between (a) students' programming behaviors and course outcomes, and (b) students' participation within an online social learning environment and course outcomes. In both studies, we developed statistical measures derived from our data that significantly correlate with students' course grades. Encouraged both by social theories of learning and a desire to improve the accuracy of our statistical models, we explore here the impact of incorporating our predictive measure derived from social behavior into three separate predictive measures derived from programming behaviors. We find that, in combining the measures, we are able to improve the overall predictive power of each measure. This finding affirms the importance of social interaction in the learning process, and provides evidence that predictive models derived from multiple sources of learning process data can provide signifficantly better predictive power by accounting for multiple factors responsible for student success.},

abstract = {Due to the COVID19 pandemic, more higher-level education programmes have moved to online channels, raising issues in monitoring students' learning progress. Thanks to advances in online learning systems, however, student data can be automatically collected and used for the investigation and prediction of the students' learning performance. In this article, we present a novel approach to analyse students' learning behaviour, as well as the relationship between these behaviours and learning assessment results, in the context of programming education. A bespoke method has been built based on a combination of Random Matrix Theory, a Community Detection algorithm and statistical hypothesis tests. The datasets contain fine-grained information about students' learning behaviours in two programming courses over two academic years with about 400 first-year students in a Medium-sized Metropolitan University in Dublin. The proposed method is a noval approach to data preprocessing which can improve the analysis and prediction based on learning behavioural datasets. The proposed approach deals with the issues of noise and trend effect in the data and has shown its success in detecting groups of students who have similar learning behaviours and outcomes. The higher performing groups have been found to be more active in practical-related activities throughout the course. Conversely, we found that the lower performing groups engage more with lecture notes instead of doing programming tasks. The learning behaviours data can also be used to predict students' outcomes (i.e. Pass or Fail the terminal exams) at the early stages of the study, using popular machine learning classification techniques.},

The education sector is one of the sectors most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Educators and students worldwide were forced to shift to online learning. Students, in particular, have suffered from the psychological impacts and learning difficulties caused by the lockdowns imposed by governments to control the pandemic. In this study, we used statistics and machine learning approaches to study the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on educations systems especially on university students' psychological health. For this purpose, a questionnaire was created,which consisted of two primary parts. The first part collects the participant's demographic and educational characteristics, while the second part gathers information about five primary dimensions: the use of digital devices, sleep habits, social communication, emotional mental state, and academic performance. The questionnaire was distributed to university students in three Arab countries: Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. A total of 1766 responses were returned and analyzed using statistical and machine learning approaches. The results showed an evident correlation between student's psychological health and the use of online education during the time COVID-19. The results also showed that there is a positive relationship between digital tools used for online education and the academic performance of students during the time of COVID-19. Finally, the results highlighted the harmful impacts of COVID-19 on the education systems. The study ends by presenting suggestions and recommendations needed to improve the current online education system. Moreover, it is warranted for universities to have a role in helping students respond to the pandemic in a healthier psychological performance.},

At the University level learning system, the method or rule adopted to identify the candidates who pass or fail differs depending on various factors such as the course, the department of study and so on. Predicting the result of a student in a course is an issue that has recently been addressed using machine learning techniques. The focus of this work is to find a way to predict a student's academic performance in the University using the machine learning approach. This is done by using the previous records of the student rather than applying course dependent formulae to predict the student's final grade. In this work, meta decision tree classifier techniques based on four representative learning algorithms, namely Adaboost, Bagging, Dagging and Grading are used to construct different decision trees. REPTree is used as the decision tree method for meta learning. These four meta learning methods have been compared separately with respect to the training and test sets. Adaboost is found to be the best meta decision classifier for predicting the student's result based on the marks obtained in the semester.},

Student performance is of prime importance as education is the key to success. At the university of Mauritius, the number of students enrolled in a course does not match the number of students graduating as not every student complete their academic cycle of 3 or 4 years. Some extend their course duration as they have to repeat the whole year or several modules, while others exit with a certificate or diploma since they lack the required number of credits to obtain a degree. Unfortunately, the registration of some students with very low average marks are terminated. This research work investigates a machine learning model to predict the performance of university students on a yearly basis. The model will forecast student performance and help take necessary actions before it is too late. The classification technique is used to train the proposed model using an existing student dataset. The training phase generates a training model that can then be used to predict student performance based on parameters such as attendance, marks, study hours, health or average performance. Different algorithms are evaluated and the classification and prediction algorithms which are more accurate are recommended.},

abstract = {In most universities, the number of students who graduated on time reflect tremendously on their operation costs. In such cases, the high number of graduate-on-time or GOT students achievement will indirectly reduce the university's annual operation cost per student. Not as trivial as it seems, to ensure most of the students able to GOT is challenging. It may vary in the perspective of university practises, academic programmes, and students' background. At the university's level, students' data can be used to identify the achievement and ability of students, interests, and weaknesses. To build an accurate predictive model, it requires an extensive study on significant factors that may contribute to students' ability to graduate on time. Consequently, this study aims to construct a predictive model that can predict students' graduation status. We applied five different machine learning algorithms (classifiers) namely Decision Tree, Random Forest, Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (PolyKernel), and Support Vector Machine (RBFKernel). These classifiers were evaluated with four different k folds of 5, 10, 15, and 20. The performance of these classifiers was compared based on different measurement subject to accuracy, precision, recall, and F-Score. The results indicated that Support Vector Machine (PolyKernel) outperformed other classifiers and the best numbers of k folds for this experiment are 5 and 20. This predictive model of GOT is hopefully will beneficial to university management and academicians to devise their strategies in helping and improving the weakness of students' academic performance and to ensure they can graduate on time.},

abstract = {This paper analyses the problem of predicting students' academic performance, a subject that is increasingly investigated within the Educational Data Mining literature. For a better understanding of the educational related phenomena, there is a continuous interest in applying supervised and unsupervised learning methods for obtaining additional insights into the students' learning process. The problem of predicting if a student will pass or fail at a certain academic discipline based on the students' grades received during the semester is a difficult one, highly dependent on various conditions such as the course, the number of examinations during the semester, the instructors and their exigences. We propose a new classification model, S PRAR (Students Performance prediction using Relational Association Rules) for predicting the final result of a student at a certain academic discipline using relational association rules (RARs). RARs extend the classical association rules for expressing various relationships between data attributes. Experiments are performed on three real academic data sets collected from Babeş-Bolyai University from Romania. The performance of the S PRAR classifier on the considered case studies is compared against existing related work, being superior to previously proposed students' performance predictors.},

abstract = {Each year, roughly 30{\%} of first-year students at US baccalaureate institutions do not return for their second year and billions of dollars are spent educating these students. Yet, little quantitative research has analyzed the causes and possible remedies for student attrition. What's more, most of the previous attempts to model attrition at traditional campuses using machine learning have focused on small, homogeneous groups of students. In this work, we model student attrition using a dataset that is composed almost exclusively of information routinely collected for record-keeping at a large, public US university. By examining the entirety of the university's student body and not a subset thereof, we use one of the largest known datasets for examining attrition at a public US university (N = 66,060). Our results show that students' second year re-enrollment and eventual graduation can be accurately predicted based on a single year of data (AUROCs = 0.887 and 0.811, respectively). We find that demographic data (such as race, gender, etc.) and pre-admission data (such as high school academics, entrance exam scores, etc.) - upon which most admissions processes are predicated - are not nearly as useful as early college performance/transcript data for these predictions. These results highlight the potential for data mining to impact student retention and success at traditional campuses.},

Student that previously excelled at the secondary school level may lose focus due to peer pressure and social lifestyle while those who previously struggled due to family distractions may be able to focus away from home, and as a result excel at the university. University admission in Nigeria is typically based on cognitive entry characteristics of a student which is mostly academic, and may not necessarily translate to excellence once in the university. In this study, the relationship between the cognitive admission entry requirements and the academic performance of students in their first year, using their CGPA and class of degree was examined using six data mining algorithms in KNIME and Orange platforms. Maximum accuracies of 50.23{\%} and 51.9{\%} respectively were observed, and the results were verified using regression models, with R 2 values of 0.207 and 0.232 recorded which indicate that students' performance in their first year is not fully explained by cognitive entry requirements.},

abstract = {The present work proposes the application of machine learning techniques to predict the final grades (FGs) of students based on their historical performance of grades. The proposal was applied to the historical academic information available for students enrolled in the computer engineering degree at an Ecuadorian university. One of the aims of the university's strategic plan is the development of a quality education that is intimately linked with sustainable development goals (SDGs). The application of technology in teaching-learning processes (Technology-enhanced learning) must become a key element to achieve the objective of academic quality and, as a consequence, enhance or benefit the common good. Today, both virtual and face-to-face educational models promote the application of information and communication technologies (ICT) in both teaching-learning processes and academic management processes. This implementation has generated an overload of data that needs to be processed properly in order to transform it into valuable information useful for all those involved in the field of education. Predicting a student's performance from their historical grades is one of the most popular applications of educational data mining and, therefore, it has become a valuable source of information that has been used for different purposes. Nevertheless, several studies related to the prediction of academic grades have been developed exclusively for the benefit of teachers and educational administrators. Little or nothing has been done to show the results of the prediction of the grades to the students. Consequently, there is very little research related to solutions that help students make decisions based on their own historical grades. This paper proposes a methodology in which the process of data collection and pre-processing is initially carried out, and then in a second stage, the grouping of students with similar patterns of academic performance was carried out. In the next phase, based on the identified patterns, the most appropriate supervised learning algorithm was selected, and then the experimental process was carried out. Finally, the results were presented and analyzed. The results showed the effectiveness of machine learning techniques to predict the performance of students.},

Machine Learning and Big Data can be useful for predicting the students' admission, performance of teaching, performance of a student, identifying the group of students of similar behavior.

As the models built in this work are predicting the likelihood of a student taking up the admission into any university based on the student data collected by any marketing agency, the combined models are collectively called as the Admission Predictor. The administrative officials of any academic institution can use this kind of an application to explore and analyze the patterns that are affecting the student admission and come up with enhanced strategies to improve admission. Such an application not only plays a vital role in administration, but also help the management in reformulating the marketing criteria for overall development of academic institution.},

abstract = {In the era of data evolution, many organizations have taken the lead in storing the data in huge data repositories. Analysis of data comes with several challenges since the time the data is captures till the insights are inferred from the data. Accentuating the accuracy of data analysis is of paramount importance as many critical decisions are totally dependent on the outcomes of the analysis. Machine learning has been found as the most effective and most preferred tool in the literature for in-memory data analytics. Universities mostly collect the statistical data related to the students that is only either used quantitatively or sparsely analyzed to gain the insights that could be useful for the authorities to enhance the percentage of placements in campus drives held through early analysis of such data accurately. The work proposed in this paper formulates the problem of predicting the likelihood of a student getting placed in a company as a binary classification problem. Then it makes an effort to train and perform the empirical study of following multiple machine learning algorithms with the placement data; Logistic Regression, Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor and Decision Tree. The machine learning classification models are built to predict the probabilities of a student getting placed in a company based on the student's academic scores, achievements, work experience (internship), and many other relevant features. Such an analysis helps the university authorities to dynamically create plans to enhance the unlikely students to be placed in a company participating in the campus recruitment held in the university. To improve these models and to avoid the models from overfitting to the training data, strategies like K-Fold cross-validation is applied for various values of k. The machine learning models selected are also compared for its efficiency by employing the supervised and unsupervised feature extraction techniques such as PCA and LDA. The Decision Tree model with K as 10 for cross-validation and PCA has outperformed all the other models producing the accuracy of 72.83{\%} with satisfactory support and recall during experimentation. The application focuses on the targeted group of students, to eventually improve the probability of students getting placed during campus recruitment drives held in the university.},

Using academic data from prior EE graduates, a machine learning algorithm was trained to predict with 85{\%} certainty whether a student's GPA will fall above/below one standard deviation from the mean. This prediction can be used to channel university resources to support those students who need it the most. However, there is a significant prediction overlap for average students, i.e. those who fall within approximately one standard deviation around the mean.

We use data of 10,196 students who finished their undergraduate studies (either by graduation or dropping out) between 2013 and 2018. We analyze dropout predictability in two main scenarios: first using data available at the time of enrollment, e.g. pre-enrollment achievement measures, and personal details, then in another scenario we supplement this feature set with first-semester performance indicators and use this richer set of attributes for further analysis. We apply artificial neural networks and boosting algorithms for prediction, and examine how the predictive power can be improved by the additional information. In other words, we study the incremental predictive validity of the early university performance indicators on graduation over the pre-enrollment achievement measures and vice versa.},

abstract = {Student Performance Analysis System is an emerging field and is very crucial to schools and universities in helping their students and professors. Most of the pre-existing methods are based only on past academic performance of students. This paper aims to develop models which can predict the student's performance and grades while keeping in mind other equally essential personality factors like interests, attributes and opinions (IAO variables) which affect their lifestyle. It uses various machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict the performance of students, and basic exploratory data analysis to derive various correlations of student's performance with psychographic attributes.},

abstract = {Educational Data Mining (EDM) is an emerging field that is concerned with mining and exploring the useful patterns in educational data. The main objective of this study is to predict the students' academic performance based on a new dataset extracted from a student information system. The dataset was extracted from a private university in the United Arab of Emirates (UAE). The dataset includes 34 attributes and 56,000 records related to students' information. The empirical results indicated that the Random Forest (RF) algorithm was the most appropriate data mining technique used to predict the students' academic performance. It is also revealed that the most important attributes that have a direct effect on the students' academic performance are belonged to four main categories, namely students' demographics, student previous performance information, course and instructor information, and student general information. The evidence from this study would assist the higher educational institutions by allowing the instructors and students to identify the weaknesses and factors affecting the students' performance, and act as an early warning system for predicting the students' failures and low academic performance.},

Early prediction of student performance is one of Educational Data Mining (EDM) application. In this paper, a set of factors like (academic, demographic, social, and behavior) and their influence on student performance have been studied for early prediction system. The authors have applied seven different machine learning (ML) models on the real data of students of Chitkara University, India. The study shows that to take preventive measures for students at risk not only current performance but the previous academic performance and demographical factors also play an important role.

abstract = {This paper presents a system, called AmonAI, that predicts the academic performances of students in the LMD system. The approach used allows to establish, for each of the teaching units of a given semester, some estimates of the students results. To achieve this, various machine learning techniques were used. In order to choose the best model for each teaching unit, we have tested 9 different algorithms offered by the Python Scikit-learn library to make predictions. The experiments were performed on data collected over two years at “Institut de Formation et de Recherche en Informatique (IFRI)” of University of Abomey-Calavi, Benin. The results obtained on the test data reveal that, on five of the nine teaching units for which the work was conducted, we obtain an F2-score of at least 75{\%} for the classification and an RMSE of less than or equal to 2.93 for the regression. The solution therefore provides relatively good results with regard to the dataset used.},

Machine learning techniques have the potential to predict the class of a dependent variable and can thus enable educational institutes to predict the academic performance of students and improve related learning processes. The purpose of this study is to predict the academic performance of international students studying at a university in North India. This study has explored the predictive potential of attributes like their attendance percentage, pending reappears, economy level, geographical region, etc. in developing a statistical model that can predict the likely performance of a student as satisfactory or poor. Machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, na{\"{i}}ve Bayes, CART and random forests have been used. Classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC curve have been used for evaluation purpose. Interpretable explanations for model outcomes have also been obtained. Classification accuracy of above 90{\%} was observed during experiments. Features like attendance percentage and pending reappears were observed to be contributing most towards prediction outcomes.},

Currently, annual expenses with dropout reach R{\$} 415 million in Brazilian currency. The purpose of this article is to identify the factors that affect students who drop out of the University of Brasilia (UnB) and Machine Learning to provide a model for predicting which students will drop out of undergraduate courses. With this, actions can be taken to reduce the dropout rate. The result of this work demonstrates that the courses with the most credits (workload), longer time to complete (5–6 year courses) and student's poorer academic performance (poor grades) influences student dropout rate. Also, social factors, such as quota holders or non-quota holders, also influence the dropout rate of undergraduate students at the University of Bras{\'{i}}lia (UnB).},

abstract = {The ability to predict failure is an advantageous educational tool that can be effectively used to counsel student, and this may also be used as a tool for developing, and channelling adequate academic interventions toward preventing failure and dropout tendencies. Students are generally admitted based on their evaluated academic potentials as measured using their admission criteria scores. This study seeks to identify the relationship, if any, between the admission criteria scores and the graduation grades, and to examine the influence of ethnicity using the geopolitical zone of origin of the student on the predictive accuracy of the models developed using a Nigerian University as a case study. Data mining analyses were carried out using four classifiers on the Orange Software, and the results were verified with multiple regression analysis. The maximum classification accuracy observed is 53.2{\%} which indicates that the pre-admission scores alone are insufficient for predicting the graduation result of students but it may serve as a useful guide. By applying over-sampling technique, the accuracy increased to 79.8{\%}. The results establish that the ethnic background of the student is statistically insignificant in predicting their graduation results. Hence, the use of ethnicity in admission processes is therefore not ideal.},
