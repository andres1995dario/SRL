abstract = {Course instructors need to be able to identify students in need of assistance as early in the course as possible. Recent work has suggested that machine learning approaches applied to snapshots of small programming exercises may be an effective solution to this problem. However, these results have been obtained using data from a single institution, and prior work using features extracted from student code has been highly sensitive to differences in context. This work provides two contributions: first, a partial reproduction of previously published results, but in a different context, and second, an exploration of the efficacy of neural networks in solving this problem. Our findings confirm the importance of two features (the number of steps required to solve a problem and the correctness of key problems), indicate that machine learning techniques are relatively stable across contexts (both across terms in a single course and across courses), and suggest that neural network based approaches are as effective as the best Bayesian and decision tree methods. Furthermore, neural networks can be tuned to be reliably pessimistic, so they may serve a complementary role in solving the problem of identifying students who need assistance.},

abstract = {Educators stand to benefit from advance predictions of their students' course performance based on learning process data collected in their courses. Indeed, such predictions can help educators not only to identify at-risk students, but also to better tailor their instructional methods. In computing education, at least two different measures, the Error Quotient [14, 23] and Watwin Score [26, 27], have achieved modest success at predicting student course performance based solely on students' compilation attempts. We hypothesize that one can achieve even greater predictive power by considering students' programming activities more holistically. To that end, we derive the Normalized Programming State Model (NPSM), which characterizes students' programming activity in terms of the dynamically-changing syntactic and semantic correctness of their programs. In an empirical study, the NPSM accounted for 41{\%} of the variance in students' programming assignment grades, and 36{\%} of the variance in students' final course grades. We identify the components of the NPSM that contribute to its explanatory power, and derive a formula capable of predicting students' course programming performance with between 36 and 67 percent accuracy, depending on the quantity of programming process data.},

In prior research, we explored the relationship between (a) students' programming behaviors and course outcomes, and (b) students' participation within an online social learning environment and course outcomes. In both studies, we developed statistical measures derived from our data that significantly correlate with students' course grades. Encouraged both by social theories of learning and a desire to improve the accuracy of our statistical models, we explore here the impact of incorporating our predictive measure derived from social behavior into three separate predictive measures derived from programming behaviors. We find that, in combining the measures, we are able to improve the overall predictive power of each measure. This finding affirms the importance of social interaction in the learning process, and provides evidence that predictive models derived from multiple sources of learning process data can provide signifficantly better predictive power by accounting for multiple factors responsible for student success.},

abstract = {Methods for automatically identifying students in need of assistance have been studied for decades. Initially, the work was based on somewhat static factors such as students' educational background and results from various questionnaires, while more recently, constantly accumulating data such as progress with course assignments and behavior in lectures has gained attention. We contribute to this work with results on early detection of students in need of assistance, and provide a starting point for using machine learning techniques on naturally accumulating programming process data. When combining source code snapshot data that is recorded from students' programming process with machine learning methods, we are able to detect high- and low-performing students with high accuracy already after the very first week of an introductory programming course. Comparison of our results to the prominent methods for predicting students' performance using source code snapshot data is also provided. This early information on students' performance is beneficial from multiple viewpoints. Instructors can target their guidance to struggling students early on, and provide more challenging assignments for high-performing students. Moreover, students that perform poorly in the introductory programming course, but who nevertheless pass, can be monitored more closely in their future studies.},

abstract = {As enrollments and class sizes in postsecondary institutions have increased, instructors have sought automated and lightweight means to identify students who are at risk of performing poorly in a course. This identification must be performed early enough in the term to allow instructors to assist those students before they fall irreparably behind. This study describes a modeling methodology that predicts student final exam scores in the third week of the term by using the clicker data that is automatically collected for instructors when they employ the Peer Instruction pedagogy. The modeling technique uses a support vector machine binary classifier, trained on one term of a course, to predict outcomes in the subsequent term. We applied this modeling technique to five different courses across the computer science curriculum, taught by three different instructors at two different institutions. Our modeling approach includes a set of strengths not seen wholesale in prior work, while maintaining competitive levels of accuracy with that work. These strengths include using a lightweight source of student data, affording early detection of struggling students, and predicting outcomes across terms in a natural setting (different final exams, minor changes to course content), across multiple courses in a curriculum, and across multiple institutions.},

abstract = {In the 21st Century, many young learners spend a lot of time learning via formal and informal electronic classroom such as Virtual Learning Environment. Therefore, many Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) have deployed virtual agents in the Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) to enhance the learning curve of the young leaners. Past reviews have highlighted that learner's satisfaction is crucial to develop sustainability of a product and to determine the efficacy of a specific learning tool. Besides this, it was also advocated that the existing Virtual Agent design facts does not cater to the heterogeneous society and is not a globalized design. To address this acute issue, this paper demonstrates the design specifications of Kansei Virtual Agent using the enhanced model identified as the Virtual Agent Design Model (VADM). The dynamic model adapted the Kansei Engineering defined as the user- centric approach that uses the quantitative analysis to identify the design specifications of a Virtual Agent. The 107 respondents are undergraduate students from a Higher Education Institution in Malaysia. The outcome suggests that User-Centered Kansei Virtual Agent contributes to a higher level of satisfaction when the learners interact with the Virtual Agent 2 (VA2) that has high emotional appeal.},

abstract = {Educational tests can be used to estimate pupils' abilities and thereby give an indication of whether their school type is suitable for them. However, tests in education are usually conducted for each content area separately which makes it difficult to combine these results into one single school advice. To help with school advice, we provide a comparison between both domain-specific and domain-agnostic methods for predicting school types. Both use data from a pupil monitoring system in the Netherlands, a system that keeps track of pupils' educational progress over several years by a series of tests measuring multiple skills. A domain-specific item response theory (IRT) model is calibrated from which an ability score is extracted and is subsequently plugged into a multinomial log-linear regression model. Second, we train domain-agnostic machine learning (ML) models. These are a random forest (RF) and a shallow neural network (NN). Furthermore, we apply case weighting to give extra attention to pupils who switched between school types. When considering the performance of all pupils, RFs provided the most accurate predictions followed by NNs and IRT respectively. When only looking at the performance of pupils who switched school type, IRT performed best followed by NNs and RFs. Case weighting proved to provide a major improvement for this group. Lastly, IRT was found to be much easier to explain in comparison to the other models. Thus, while ML provided more accurate results, this comes at the cost of a lower explainability in comparison to IRT.},

Since then, this has been the goal of many of these institutions in the Philippines. However, the efforts of these institutions to deliver quality education aimed to equip the students often fall short when students are found to be under-performing academically because of over-exposure and addiction to social media. The challenge now with educators is to assess the performance of these students at an early stage and do the necessary interventions. With this, the researcher saw an opportunity to create a predictive classification model that can be used in predicting the academic performance of higher education students. Through Support Vector Machine (SVM), the academic profile of past students are categorized into performing and under-performing and this formed part of the predictive classification model. The accuracy of the model have been measured through cross-validation. The test results revealed that the model were able to appropriately predict if a student needs intervention or not with respect to academic performance.},

We are developing a predictive model based on a deep artificial neural network to predict students' academic performance of upcoming courses based on their grades in previous courses of the first academic year. We have used one of the most common resampling methods, which is the SMOTE approach to handle the problem of the imbalanced dataset. The preliminary results show that our proposed model has achieved 86{\%} accuracy. To put our system in context, we compared our results to some traditional machine learning techniques such as Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Random Forest, which were applied to an online dataset that has been widely used in some previous works. The comparison showed that our experimental results have achieved better results than the other traditional models. In future work, we will use a larger dataset to improve the accuracy of our models.

CCS CONCEPTS • Software and its engineering → Software testing and debugging; Software performance; • Computing methodologies → Machine learning. Performance describes the resource and time bound aspects of a software system behavior and is often described in terms of some sub-characteristics like time behavior, resource utilization and capacity [1]. Performance evaluation is generally conducted to I. measure the performance metrics, II. detect the functional problems appearing under certain performance-related execution conditions like heavy workload, III. detect non-functional problems, i.e., violations of non-functional requirements such as performance and robustness. Stress testing is often considered as a type of performance testing which implies applying extreme execution conditions to meet those objectives and verify the robustness of the system. Finding the performance breaking point of the software under test (SUT), at which the system functionality breaks, or the performance requirements are violated, is one of the main objectives in the stress testing activity. The emergence of anomalies in the performance behavior of a software system is resulted from performance bottlenecks. There are various application-, platform-, and workload-wise causes resulting in the emergence of performance bottlenecks. In stress testing, providing extreme (stress) test conditions involves changing (manipulating) the platform-and workload-wise factors affecting the performance. Generating stress test conditions to analyze the performance behavior under extreme conditions remains a challenge for complex software systems. 2 MOTIVATION AND BACKGROUND Performance modeling and performance testing are common approaches for doing performance analysis. Performance modeling is often based on building a performance model of the system behavior and measuring the target performance metrics. It can be done using various modeling notations like Markov Processes, queueing networks, petri nets and simulation models [6, 10, 15, 20, 22, 25]. Performance testing is considered as a family of performance-related testing techniques intended for addressing the objectives of performance analysis. Performance, load and stress testing might considerably overlap in many areas. Nevertheless, the objectives of the performance-related testing methods could be summarized as follows: I. Measuring the performance metrics under different execution conditions including various workload and resource configurations [8, 16-19, 21, 23, 26, 28, 30]. II. Detecting the functional problems appearing under certain execution conditions regarding workload and resource configurations [4, 5, 7, 11, 27, 31]. III. Detecting violations of non-functional requirements under expected and stress conditions [2, 3, 9, 12-14, 19, 30]. In general, using source code or system model analysis or use-case 1187},

The ability to predict a student's performance can be beneficial for actions in modern educational systems. Existing methods have used features which are mostly related to academic performance, family income and family assets; while features belonging to family expenditures and students' personal information are usually ignored. In this paper, an effort is made to investigate aforementioned feature sets by collecting the scholarship holding students' data from different universities of Pakistan. Learning analytics, discriminative and generative classification models are applied to predict whether a student will be able to complete his degree or not. Experimental results show that proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods due to exploitation of family expenditures and students' personal information feature sets. Outcomes of this EDM/LA research can serve as policy improvement method in higher education.},

Throughout the years, education faced a number of challenges. Different methods of teaching and learning are suggested to increase the learning quality. In today's world, computers and portable devices are employed in every phase of daily life and many materials are available online anytime, anywhere. Technologies like Artificial Intelligence had a surprising evolution in many fields especially in educational teaching and learning processes. Higher education institutions have started to adopt the use of technology into their traditional teaching mechanisms for enhancing learning and teaching. In this paper, two datasets have been considered for the prediction and classification of student performance respectively using five machine learning algorithms. Eighteen experiments have been performed and preliminary results suggest that performances of students might be predictable and classification of these performances can be increased by applying pre-processing to the raw data before implementing machine learning algorithms.

It was hypothesized that students' academic performance in online learning could be modeled through their online learning capabilities, attitudes towards online learning, and online learning academic self-concept. Toward this goal, 264 students answered a validated survey form. Multinomial logistic regression analyses showed that perceived academic performance in terms of perceived grade attainment and perceived learning achievements had different sets of predictors. This finding indicates that perceived academic performance in an online learning environment has two distinct measures with distinct sets of predictors. Additional analyses revealed that the students are further distinguished when the predictors were categorized by levels of academic performance. Implications to online teaching and recommendations are discussed.},

@article{Molla-Campello2018,
abstract = {It is widely demonstrated that academic performance depends on many different factors, and those have a different specific weight depending on the evaluated subject or the academic level. This paper proposes a methodology that includes a mechanism to measure the weight of the variables that really have a direct impact on academic performance. To address this problem, which falls within the scope of prediction, it is appropriate to resort to classification techniques that model academic performance as a discrete variable, even if that variable has a continuous nature. This article presents a methodology based on the hypothesis that the way the performance variable is discretized will significantly affect the predictive models generated. This work highlights a relation between the factorization criteria and the most-relevant attributes selected to classify instances. Also, the paper shows a relation between the predictive model obtained and the target variable factorization criteria.

We also find the seating positions of the top students are more concentrated, especially the top firsts, who prefer to sit in the second row and center columns near the aisle, and seldom change their seats during the whole semester. This physical concentration is a reflection of their mental concentration and is also highly correlated with their high academic achievement.

abstract = {In this paper we attempt to deduce student attrition at a South African higher-education institution with the aim of identifying students who are likely to be in need of academic support so that a focus could be provided on improving their academic performance. The significance of this paper is on using computer science and information technology to address learner attrition (an African reality) and thereby impact the low university throughput and retention rates positively. We trained several machine learning classification models to deduce the student into four risk classes using only Grade 12 marks and background characteristics of the learner. We provide the following contributions: (a) the first known published trained classifier able to calculate the distribution over a students' risk profile for a South African university focused on the conceptual framework; (b) a ranking of employed features according to their entropy to correctly classify the class variable; (c) a comparison of trained classifiers able to calculate the probability of a students' risk profile for a South African higher-education research-intensive university; and (d) an interactive program which is able to calculate the posterior probability over the student's risk profile so that support can be provided to them. The random forest classification model achieves the best performance with a 82{\%} accuracy over these four risk profiles. We argue for introducing predictive tools to enhance student success and student support initiatives in Higher-Education Institutions. This work will benefit academic developers and staff who provide support to students who are at academic risk of completing their undergraduate Science programmes.},

@article{Abisado2019,
abstract = {A learning environment is comprised of emotional and cognitive activities. The need to incorporate the measurement of student affect during the learning assessment is necessary. This study measured academic affect during assessment and developed an online examination multi-modal academic affect model. Using the matic analysis and expert opinion, the study generated the presence of the following academic affect: relaxed, curious, bored, frustrated, and distracted. The academic affects were annotated with a computed interrater kappa value of 0.62. Annotation by the coders was mapped with the features extracted from a behavior analysis toolkit that produced the Filipino Online Examination Multi-Modal Affect Dataset. The model yielded an accuracy of 92.66{\%}.},

@article{Tsiakmaki2020,
abstract = {Predicting students' learning outcomes is one of the main topics of interest in the area of Educational Data Mining. To this end, a plethora of machine learning methods have been successfully applied for solving a variety of predictive problems. However, it is of utmost importance to develop accurate and explainable learning models at low cost. Fuzzy logic constitutes the appropriate approach for building models of high performance and explainability. In addition, active learning reduces both the time and cost of labeling effort exploiting a small pool of labeled examples together with a large pool of unlabeled ones in the most efficient way, assuming that an expert provides the true labels of the most informative unlabeled examples during the training process. In this context, the present study introduces a fuzzy-based active learning method for predicting student academic performance. Initially, we provide a comparative study on the efficacy of fuzzy learning in five compulsory courses. Therefore, we evaluate the predictive performance of six classes of fuzzy classifiers on datasets regarding students' online activity in each course. In addition, we propose a fuzzy-based method exploiting the potential of the active learning approach. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method for the accurate prediction of students at risk of failure.},

@article{Bajpai2018,
abstract = {Social media has become an integral part of our lives. In the millennial era, it is all the more intriguing in the lives of the University students. WhatsApp, Instagram, LinkedIn, Snapchat, Google Plus or YouTube are extensively used by them. The students may use social media for connectivity, sharing personal and academic information, entertainment or for any other reason. Moreover, more than one platform might be in use. There is a shift in the methodology of study from the use of books and papers to the tablets, laptops and even smart phones. All the gadgets have plethora of information available through internet which may act as a distraction from studies to the students. This paper therefore, is an attempt to analyze the extent to which the use of social media affects the academic performance of the students. A survey was administered to the engineering students of a University in Dubai through a questionnaire and SPSS software is used for analysis. The analysis highlights the fact that in the millennial era, it is not advisable to restrict the use of social media for the students. However, the students need to be counseled for using the social media for academic purposes and not get swayed towards just socializing. A balance between both the purposes will be the most preferred scenario.},

abstract = {The early identification of college students at risk of dropout is of great interest and importance all over the world, since the early leaving of higher education is associated with considerable personal and social costs. In Hungary, especially in STEM undergraduate programs, the dropout rate is particularly high, much higher than the EU average. In this work, using advanced machine learning models such as deep neural networks and gradient boosted trees, we aim to predict the final academic performance of students at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. The dropout prediction is based on the data that are available at the time of enrollment. In addition to the predictions, we also interpret our machine learning models with the help of state-of-the-art interpretable machine learning techniques such as permutation importance and SHAP values. The accuracy and AUC of the best-performing deep learning model are 72.4{\%} and 0.771, respectively that slightly outperforms XGBoost, the cutting-edge benchmark model for tabular data.},
