abstract = {Educational data mining has received considerable attention in the last few years. Many data mining techniques are proposed to extract the hidden knowledge from educational data. The extracted knowledge helps the institutions to improve their teaching methods and learning process. All these improvements lead to enhance the performance of the students and the overall educational outputs. In this paper, we propose a new student's performance prediction model based on data mining techniques with new data attributes/features, which are called student's behavioral features. These type of features are related to the learner's interactivity with the e-learning management system. The performance of student's predictive model is evaluated by set of classifiers, namely; Artificial Neural Network, Na{\"{i}}ve Bayesian and Decision tree. In addition, we applied ensemble methods to improve the performance of these classifiers. We used Bagging, Boosting and Random Forest (RF), which are the common ensemble methods used in the literature. The obtained results reveal that there is a strong relationship between learner's behaviors and their academic achievement. The accuracy of the proposed model using behavioral features achieved up to 22.1{\%} improvement comparing to the results when removing such features and it achieved up to 25.8{\%} accuracy improvement using ensemble methods. By testing the model using newcomer students, the achieved accuracy is more than 80{\%}. This result proves the reliability of the proposed model},

This study was carried out with 772 examples of students registered in e-commerce and e-commerce technologies modules at an HEI. The study aimed to predict student's overall performance at the end of the semester using video learning analytics and data mining techniques. Data from the student information system, learning management system and mobile applications were analyzed using eight different classification algorithms. Furthermore, data transformation and preprocessing techniques were carried out to reduce the features. Moreover, genetic search and principle component analysis were carried out to further reduce the features. Additionally, the CN2 Rule Inducer and multivariate projection can be used to assist faculty in interpreting the rules to gain insights into student interactions.

That is essential in order to help at-risk students and assure their retention, providing the excellent learning resources and experience, and improving the university's ranking and reputation. However, that might be difficult to be achieved for startup to mid-sized universities, especially those which are specialized in graduate and post graduate programs, and have small students' records for analysis. So, the main aim of this project is to prove the possibility of training and modeling a small dataset size and the feasibility of creating a prediction model with credible accuracy rate. This research explores as well the possibility of identifying the key indicators in the small dataset, which will be utilized in creating the prediction model, using visualization and clustering algorithms. Best indicators were fed into multiple machine learning algorithms to evaluate them for the most accurate model. Among the selected algorithms, the results proved the ability of clustering algorithm in identifying key indicators in small datasets.

Learning analytics is a methodology for helping students to succeed in the classroom; the principle is to predict student's academic performance at an early stage and thus provide them with timely assistance. Accordingly, this study used multiple linear regression (MLR), a popular method of predicting students' academic performance, to establish a prediction model. Moreover, we combined MLR with principal component analysis (PCA) to improve the predictive accuracy of the model. TraditionalMLR has certain drawbacks; specifically, the coefficient of determination (R2) and mean square error (MSE) measures and the quantile-quantile plot (Q-Q plot) technique cannot evaluate the predictive performance and accuracy of MLR. Therefore, we propose predictive MSE (pMSE) and predictive mean absolute percentage correction (pMAPC) measures for determining the predictive performance and accuracy of the regression model, respectively. Analysis results revealed that the proposed model for predicting students' academic performance could obtain optimal pMSE and pMAPC values by using six components obtained from PCA.},

To examine the effectiveness of the proposed RTV-SVM, 32,593 university students on seven courses were chosen for performance evaluation. Analysis reveals that the RTV-SVM achieved a training vector reduction of at least 59.7{\%} without altering the margin or accuracy of the classifier.

Currently in Malaysia, the lack of existing system to analyze and monitor the student progress and performance is not being addressed. There are two main reasons of why this is happening. First, the study on existing prediction methods is still insufficient to identify the most suitable methods for predicting the performance of students in Malaysian institutions. Second is due to the lack of investigations on the factors affecting students achievements in particular courses within Malaysian context. Therefore, a systematical literature review on predicting student performance by using data mining techniques is proposed to improve students achievements. The main objective of this paper is to provide an overview on the data mining techniques that have been used to predict students performance. This paper also focuses on how the prediction algorithm can be used to identify the most important attributes in a students data. We could actually improve students achievement and success more effectively in an efficient way using educational data mining techniques.

abstract = {Student's academic performance prediction empowers educational technologies including academic trajectory and degree planning, course recommender systems, early warning and advising systems. Given a student's past data (such as grades in prior courses), the task of student's performance prediction is to predict a student's grades in future courses. Academic programs are structured in a way that prior courses lay the foundation for future courses. The knowledge required by courses is obtained by taking multiple prior courses, which exhibits complex relationships modeled by graph structures. Traditional methods for student's performance prediction usually neglect the underlying relationships between multiple courses; and how students acquire knowledge across them. In addition, traditional methods do not provide interpretation for predictions needed for decision making. In this work, we propose a novel attention-based graph convolutional networks model for student's performance prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world dataset obtained from a large public university. The experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of grade prediction. The proposed model also shows strong accuracy in identifying students who are at-risk of failing or dropping out so that timely intervention and feedback can be provided to the student.},

abstract = {Understanding, modeling, and predicting student performance in higher education poses signiflcant challenges concerning the design of accurate and robust diagnostic models. While numerous studies attempted to develop intelligent classiflers for anticipating student achievement, they overlooked the importance of identifying the key factors that lead to the achieved performance. Such identiflcation is essential to empower program leaders to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of their academic programs, and thereby take the necessary corrective interventions to ameliorate student achievements. To this end, our paper contributes, flrstly, a hybrid regression model that optimizes the prediction accuracy of student academic performance, measured as future grades in different courses, and, secondly, an optimized multi-label classifier that predicts the qualitative values for the influence of various factors associated with the obtained student performance. The prediction of student performance is produced by combining three dynamically weighted techniques, namely collaborative flltering, fuzzy set rules, and Lasso linear regression. However, the multi-label prediction of the influential factors is generated using an optimized self-organizing map. We empirically investigate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our entire approach on seven publicly available and varying datasets. The experimental results showconsiderable improvements compared to single baseline models (e.g. linear regression, matrix factorization), demonstrating the practicality of the proposed approach in pinpointing multiple factors impacting student performance. As future works, this research emphasizes the need to predict the student attainment of learning outcomes.},

The proposed system coined as ScholarLite harnesses the power of machine learning to extract research themes from faculty members' past publications, mines research interests from their resumes, and combines it with their educational background to generate recommendations for course teaching, research supervision, and industry-academia collaboration. We have shown the recommendation results on real-world data gathered from the higher education commission of the country and demonstrated that the proposed techniques are scalable across various programs offered by the universities and could be deployed in a small budget by universities for automating course and supervisor allocation procedures. The experiments confirm our performance expectation by showing good relevance and objectivity in results, thus making this decision management system more appealing for large-scale deployment and use by academia.},

abstract = {Educational institutions continually strive to improve the services they offer, their aim is to have the best possible teaching staff, increase the quality of teaching and the academic performance of their students. A knowledge of the factors that affect student learning could help universities and study centres adjust their curricula and teaching methods to the needs of their students. One of the first measures employed by teaching institutions was to create Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs). This type of environment makes it possible to attract a larger number of students because it enables them to study from wherever they are in the world, meaning that the student's location is no longer a constraint. Moreover, VLEs facilitate access to teaching resources, they make it easier to monitor the activity of the teaching staff and of the interactions between students and teachers. Thus, online environments make it possible to assess the factors that cause the students' academic performance to increase or decrease. To understand the factors that influence the university learning process, this paper applies a series of automatic learning techniques to a public dataset, including tree-based models and different types of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Having applied these techniques to the dataset, the number of times students have accessed the resources made available on VLE platforms has been identified as a key factor affecting student performance. This factor has been analysed by conducting a real case study which has involved 120 students doing a masters degree over a VLE platform. Concretely, the case study participants were masters degree students in areas related to computer engineering at the University of Salamanca.},

By leveraging historical student data, we built predictive models using students' offline (static) information including student characteristics and demographics, and online (dynamic) resources using programming and behaviour activity logs. Predictions are generated weekly during semester. Overall, the predictive and personalised feedback helped to reduce the gap between the lower and higher-performing students. Furthermore, students praised the prediction and the personalised feedback, conveying strong recommendations for future students to use the system. We also found that students who followed their personalised guidance and recommendations performed better in examinations.},

abstract = {The present work proposes the application of machine learning techniques to predict the final grades (FGs) of students based on their historical performance of grades. The proposal was applied to the historical academic information available for students enrolled in the computer engineering degree at an Ecuadorian university. One of the aims of the university's strategic plan is the development of a quality education that is intimately linked with sustainable development goals (SDGs). The application of technology in teaching-learning processes (Technology-enhanced learning) must become a key element to achieve the objective of academic quality and, as a consequence, enhance or benefit the common good. Today, both virtual and face-to-face educational models promote the application of information and communication technologies (ICT) in both teaching-learning processes and academic management processes. This implementation has generated an overload of data that needs to be processed properly in order to transform it into valuable information useful for all those involved in the field of education. Predicting a student's performance from their historical grades is one of the most popular applications of educational data mining and, therefore, it has become a valuable source of information that has been used for different purposes. Nevertheless, several studies related to the prediction of academic grades have been developed exclusively for the benefit of teachers and educational administrators. Little or nothing has been done to show the results of the prediction of the grades to the students. Consequently, there is very little research related to solutions that help students make decisions based on their own historical grades. This paper proposes a methodology in which the process of data collection and pre-processing is initially carried out, and then in a second stage, the grouping of students with similar patterns of academic performance was carried out. In the next phase, based on the identified patterns, the most appropriate supervised learning algorithm was selected, and then the experimental process was carried out. Finally, the results were presented and analyzed. The results showed the effectiveness of machine learning techniques to predict the performance of students.},

abstract = {The assessment in outcome-based learning is very vital. A significant approach toward measuring the student performance is required. Nowadays, the amounts of data that are stored in educational database are increasing rapidly. At any point of time, the institutions face various problems. One is the poor performance of the student. Second one is the exit of a student due to the complexity of curriculum, financial problems, psychological problems, lack of support, etc. To handle these issues, machine learning can be utilized. Considerable work has been done to measure the student's performance by using different methodologies and modern technologies. In this work, the machine learning (ML) algorithms have been implemented on the student dataset of a university to predict the student's performance. Based on the analysis of the result, it has been concluded that accuracy of the random forest (RF) classifier is more than the other classification method such as support vector machine (SVM).},

abstract = {Predicting students' academic performance at an early stage of a semester is one of the most crucial research topics in the field of Educational Data Mining (EDM). Students are facing various difficulties in courses like 'Programming' and 'Data Structures' through undergraduate programs, which is why failure and dropout rates in these courses are high. Therefore, EDM is used to analyze students' data gathered from various educational settings to predict students' academic performance, which would help them to achieve better results in their future courses. The main goal of this paper is to explore the efficiency of deep learning in the field of EDM, especially in predicting students' academic performance, to identify students at risk of failure. A dataset collected from a public 4-year university was used in this study to develop predictive models to predict students' academic performance of upcoming courses given their grades in the previous courses of the first academic year using a deep neural network (DNN), decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, logistic regression, support vector classifier, and K-nearest neighbor. In addition, we made a comparison between various resampling methods to solve the imbalanced dataset problem, such as SMOTE, ADASYN, ROS, and SMOTE-ENN. From the experimental results, it is observed that the proposed DNN model can predict students' performance in a data structure course and can also identify students at risk of failure at an early stage of a semester with an accuracy of 89{\%}, which is higher than models like decision tree, logistic regression, support vector classifier, and K-nearest neighbor.},

abstract = {It has been witnessed that supportive learning has played a crucial role in educational quality enhancement. School and family tutoring offer personalized help and provide positive feedback on students' learning. Predicting students' performance is of much interest which reflects their understanding on the subjects. Particularly it is desired students to manage well in fundamental knowledge in order to build a strong foundation for post-secondary studies and career. In this paper, improved conditional generative adversarial network based deep support vector machine (ICGAN-DSVM) algorithm has been proposed to predict students' performance under supportive learning via school and family tutoring. Owning to the nature of the students' academic dataset is generally low sample size. ICGAN-DSVM offers dual benefits for the nature of low sample size in students' academic dataset in which ICGAN increases the data volume whereas DSVM enhances the prediction accuracy with deep learning architecture. Results with 10-fold cross-validation show that the proposed ICGAN-DSVM yields specificity, sensitivity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.968, 0.971 and 0.954 respectively. Results also suggest that incorporating both school and family tutoring into the prediction model could further improve the performance compared with only school tutoring and only family tutoring. To show the necessity of ICGAN and DSVM, comparison has been made between ICGAN and traditional conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN). Also, the proposed kernel design via heuristic based multiple kernel learning (MKL) is compared with typical kernels including linear, radial basis function (RBF), polynomial and sigmoid. The prediction of student's performance with and without GAN is presented which is followed by comparison with DSVM and with traditional SVM. The proposed ICGAN-DSVM outperforms related works by 8-29{\%} in terms of performance indicators specificity, sensitivity and AUC.},

abstract = {Dyslexia is a neurological disorder that is characterized by imprecise comprehension of words and generally poor reading performance. It affects a significant population of school-age children, with more occurrences in males, thus, putting them at risk of poor academic performance and low self-esteem for a lifetime. The long-term hope is to have a dyslexia diagnostic method that is informed by neural-biomarkers. In this regard, large numbers of machine learning methods and, more recently, deep learning methods have been implemented across various types of dataset with the above-chance classification accuracy. However, attainment of clinical acceptability of these state-of-the-art methods is bedeviled by certain challenges including lack of biologically-interpretable biomarkers, privacy of dataset and classifiers, hyper-parameter selection/optimization, and overfitting problem among others. This review paper critically analyzes recent machine learning methods for detecting dyslexia and its biomarkers and discusses challenges that require proper attentions from the users of deep learning methods in order to enable them to attain clinically relevance and acceptable level. The review is conducted within the premise of implementation and experimental outcomes for each of the 22 selected articles using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol, with a view to outlining some critical challenges for achieving high accuracy and reliability of the state-of-the-art machine learning methods. As an evidence-based protocol for reporting in systematic reviews and meta-analyses, PRISMA helps to ensure clarity and transparency of this paper by showing a four-phase flow diagram of the selection process for articles used in this review. It is therefore, envisaged that higher classification performance of clinical relevance can be achieved using deep learning models for dyslexia and its biomarkers by addressing identified potential challenges.},

abstract = {Digital data trails from disparate sources covering different aspects of student life are stored daily in most modern university campuses. However, it remains challenging to (i) combine these data to obtain a holistic view of a student, (ii) use these data to accurately predict academic performance, and (iii) use such predictions to promote positive student engagement with the university. To initially alleviate this problem, in this article, a model named Augmented Education (AugmentED) is proposed. In our study, (1) first, an experiment is conducted based on a real-world campus dataset of college students ( N =156 ) that aggregates multisource behavioral data covering not only online and offline learning but also behaviors inside and outside of the classroom. Specifically, to gain in-depth insight into the features leading to excellent or poor performance, metrics measuring the linear and nonlinear behavioral changes (e.g., regularity and stability) of campus lifestyles are estimated; furthermore, features representing dynamic changes in temporal lifestyle patterns are extracted by the means of long short-term memory (LSTM). (2) Second, machine learning-based classification algorithms are developed to predict academic performance. (3) Finally, visualized feedback enabling students (especially at-risk students) to potentially optimize their interactions with the university and achieve a study-life balance is designed. The experiments show that the AugmentED model can predict students' academic performance with high accuracy.},

Data from the student information system, learning management system and mobile applications were analyzed using eight different classification algorithms. Furthermore, data transformation and preprocessing techniques were carried out to reduce the features. Moreover, genetic search and principle component analysis were carried out to further reduce the features. Additionally, the CN2 Rule Inducer and multivariate projection can be used to assist faculty in interpreting the rules to gain insights into student interactions. The results showed that Random Forest accurately predicted successful students at the end of the class with an accuracy of 88.3{\%} with an equal width and information gain ratio.},

abstract = {The student's performance prediction is an important research topic because it can help teachers prevent students from dropping out before final exams and identify students that need additional assistance. The objective of this study is to predict the difficulties that students will encounter in a subsequent digital design course session. We analyzed the data logged by a technology-enhanced learning (TEL) system called digital electronics education and design suite (DEEDS) using machine learning algorithms. The machine learning algorithms included an artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machines (SVMs), logistic regression, Na{\"{i}}ve bayes classifiers and decision trees. The DEEDS system allows students to solve digital design exercises with different levels of difficulty while logging input data. The input variables of the current study were average time, total number of activities, average idle time, average number of keystrokes and total related activity for each exercise during individual sessions in the digital design course; the output variables were the student(s) grades for each session. We then trained machine learning algorithms on the data from the previous session and tested the algorithms on the data from the upcoming session. We performed k-fold cross-validation and computed the receiver operating characteristic and root mean square error metrics to evaluate the models' performances. The results show that ANNs and SVMs achieve higher accuracy than do other algorithms. ANNs and SVMs can easily be integrated into the TEL system; thus, we would expect instructors to report improved student's performance during the subsequent session.},

abstract = {The early classification of university students according to their potential academic performance can be a useful strategy to mitigate failure, to promote the achievement of better results and to better manage resources in higher education institutions. This paper proposes a two-stage model, supported by data mining techniques, that uses the information available at the end of the first year of students' academic career (path) to predict their overall academic performance. Unlike most literature on educational data mining, academic success is inferred from both the average grade achieved and the time taken to conclude the degree. Furthermore, this study proposes to segment students based on the dichotomy between the evidence of failure or high performance at the beginning of the degree program, and the students' performance levels predicted by the model. A data set of 2459 students, spanning the years from 2003 to 2015, from a European Engineering School of a public research University, is used to validate the proposed methodology. The empirical results demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to predict the students' performance level with an accuracy above 95{\%}, in an early stage of the students' academic path. It is found that random forests are superior to the other classification techniques that were considered (decision trees, support vector machines, naive Bayes, bagged trees and boosted trees). Together with the prediction model, the suggested segmentation framework represents a useful tool to delineate the optimum strategies to apply, in order to promote higher performance levels and mitigate academic failure, overall increasing the quality of the academic experience provided by a higher education institution.},

During the past decade, researchers have proposed many variants of machine learning techniques in education domains. However, there are severe challenges in handling imbalanced datasets for enhancing the performance of predicting student grades. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of machine learning techniques to predict the final student grades in the first semester courses by improving the performance of predictive accuracy. Two modules will be highlighted in this paper. First, we compare the accuracy performance of six well-known machine learning techniques namely Decision Tree (J48), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF) using 1282 real student's course grade dataset. Second, we proposed a multiclass prediction model to reduce the overfitting and misclassification results caused by imbalanced multi-classification based on oversampling Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) with two features selection methods. The obtained results show that the proposed model integrates with RF give significant improvement with the highest f-measure of 99.5{\%}. This proposed model indicates the comparable and promising results that can enhance the prediction performance model for imbalanced multi-classification for student grade prediction.},

abstract = {As a kind of data that can reflect learning status, e-book logs have been widely used in learning analytics, especially for the prediction of academic performance. However, the best prediction model cannot be found without determining the contribution of e-book logs to the prediction performance of the model and its creation process. To this end, this study used the scikit-learn, a free software machine learning library, to analyze learning performance of 234 participants by learning behavior logs, which were collected by an e-book system. Finally, six prediction models containing Decision Tree, Random Forests, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and K-nearest Neighbors were created. Also, the contribution of e-book logs on the establishment of different prediction models was obtained by three feature importance calculation methods, i.e., the impurity-based feature importance, coefficients feature importance, and permutation feature importance. Based on statistical results, it was concluded that the Decision Tree and Random Forests had the best prediction performance, which was compared to the other four models, with prediction performance scores ranging from 0.7 to 0.8. Besides, the four data features of Prev, Highlight, Maker, and Next were found to have the greatest impact on model prediction creation.},

abstract = {Every educational system organizational goal is to provide a good and fruitful knowledge to the students. Now a days most of the educational institutions are spending most of their time and economy on finding out students' performance. By analyzing the performance, they identify certain cluster of the students for whom they must give extra bit of care and actions, so that they performance gets enhanced. Researchers have recently proposed several machine learning-based algorithms for predicting academic achievement. In this paper, Linear Regression algorithm and Random Forest algorithm are used to predict a student's academic achievement. On the basis of confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 ranking, the performance of two algorithms was compared to that of existing algorithms. The Random Forest algorithm-based prediction is more accurate, according to the results report.},

abstract = {The main purpose of this research work is to predict the academic performance of students from the Public Technological Higher Education Institute "Manuel Nu{\~{n}}ez Butron"(IESTP MNB) located in the Juliaca city in the Department of Puno, Peru. The data of the academic process from the first semester will be used in this proposal, considering that it is very important for an Institution to know previously the possible academic performance of its students and reduce their desertion. That is to say, good or bad academic performance in the first semester at the institution, which will subsequently redound in future semesters. The prediction will help us to project strategies that together with the institution, teachers, students, and parents can improve their activities of the teaching-learning process. To achieve the purpose of prediction, Machine Learning will be used, specifically, classification techniques to design a predictive model that allows to determine the academic performance of students and reduce their desertion, likewise to determine the best predictive algorithm.},
